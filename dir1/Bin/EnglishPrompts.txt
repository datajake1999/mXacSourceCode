Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
Will we ever forget it.
God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
Gad, your letter came just in time.
He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
It's the aurora borealis.
There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
There was a change now.
I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
Their forces were already moving into the north country.
I had faith in them.
They were three hundred yards apart.
Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
She turned in at the hotel.
I was the only one who remained sitting.
We'll have to watch our chances.
The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
He moved away as quietly as he had come.
The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
It was a curious coincidence.
Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
There was nothing on the rock.
Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
I have no idea, replied Philip.
I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
His immaculate appearance was gone.
Anyway, no one saw her like that.
Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
The men stared into each other's face.
Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
In a flash Philip followed its direction.
It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
What was the object of your little sensation.
But who was Eileen's double.
The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
There has been a change, she interrupted him.
The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
It is the fire, partly, she said.
Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
It was a large canoe.
What if Jeanne failed him.
What if she did not come to the rock.
His face was streaming with blood.
A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
Death had come with terrible suddenness.
Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
The singing voice approached rapidly.
His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
For a full minute he crouched and listened.
He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
Shall I carry you.
A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
You must sleep, he urged.
You, you would not keep the truth from me.
He will follow us soon.
But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
If you only could know how I thank you.
He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
He was wounded in the arm.
I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
Pierre obeys me when we are together.
Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
She had died from cold and starvation.
It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
Each day she became a more vital part of him.
It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
Her face was against his breast.
She was his now, forever.
Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
Now these things had been struck dead within him.
For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
Does that look good.
They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
Philip made no effort to follow.
He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
I was near the cabin, and saw you.
Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
The date was nearly eighteen years old.
They were the presage of storm.
Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
So cheer up, and give us your paw.
This time he did not yap for mercy.
And the air was growing chilly.
Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
He did not rush in.
It was edged with ice.
He drank of the water cautiously.
But a strange thing happened.
He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
He cried, and swung the club wildly.
She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
They were following the shore of a lake.
The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
From now on we're pals.
He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
How much was it.
Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
It was not a large lake, and almost round.
Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
They die out of spite.
The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
I don't know why you're here at all.
What part of the United States is your home.
My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
That came before my A B C's.
It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
But it contributed to the smash.
The last one I knew was an overseer.
Do you know any good land around here.
The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
I cannot follow you, she said.
I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
His voice was passionately rebellious.
Don't you see I hate you.
So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
Wash your hands of me.
I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
I saw it when she rolled.
I only read the quotations.
He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
They ought to pass here some time today.
I had been sad too long already.
All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
Think of investing in such an adventure.
Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
I have been doubly baptized.
They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
You can take a vacation on pay.
They are big trees and require plenty of room.
And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
It would give me nervous prostration.
She said with chattering teeth.
I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
Keep an eye on him.
Those are my oysters, he said at last.
They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
One by one the boys were captured.
The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
They were deep in the primeval forest.
He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
Bassett was a fastidious man.
There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
But all my dreams violated this law.
It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
I graduated last of my class.
They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
Therefore, hurrah for the game.
It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
He was a wise hyena.
Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
This is a common experience with all of us.
He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
Ah, indeed.
Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
This is no place for you.
He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
The fighting had now become intermittent.
They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
It was like the beating of hoofs.
Why, doggone you all, shake again.
Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
Get down and dig in.
They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
It was more like sugar.
I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
A burst of laughter was his reward.
You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
Nope, not the slightest idea.
It is not an attempt to smash the market.
We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
These rumors may even originate with us.
A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
He saw all men in the business game doing this.
It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
Points of view, new ideas, life.
But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
How old are you, daddy.
But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
My name's Ferguson.
Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
That's what Carnegie did.
I can't argue with you, and you know that.
Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
It was my idea to a tee.
Mab, she said.
I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
And here's another idea.
Manuel had one besetting sin.
The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
He could feel a new stir in the land.
So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
But I am at the end of my resources.
Now our figuring was all right.
It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
By golly, the boy wins.
Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
They do not know the length of time of incubation.
Enters now the psychology of the situation.
It was not exactly a deportation.
Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
The boy at the wheel lost his head.
To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
But Martin smiled a superior smile.
By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
Yes, sir, I corrected.
Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
You live on an income which your father earned.
He was worth nothing to the world.
Then you don't believe in altruism.
The creative joy, I murmured.
He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
What I saw I could not at first believe.
The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
I had forgotten their existence.
Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
And so early in the voyage, too.
In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
He spat it out like so much venom.
I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
The night was calm and snowy.
I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
Tom Spink has a harpoon.
Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
No-sir-ee.
Each insult added to the value of the claim.
For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
Their love burned with increasing brightness.
They were artists, not biologists.
Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
And Tom King patiently endured.
King took every advantage he knew.
The lines were now very taut.
And right there I saw and knew it all.
Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
He was an athlete and a giant.
We fished sharks on Niihau together.
The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
Also, there was awe in their faces.
Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
Without them he could not run his empire.
For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
Men who endure it, call it living death.
As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
May drought destroy your crops.
Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
But Johannes could, and did.
A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
He would destroy all things that are fixed.
He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
The Warden with a quart of champagne.
Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
He may anticipate the day of his death.
The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
This also became part of the daily schedule.
All an appearance can know is mirage.
Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
The last refugee had passed.
And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
What the flaming.
Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
With them were Indians, also three other men.
Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
I never saw anything like her in my life.
There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.

Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
But we'll just postpone this.
There was the Emma Louisa.
This is my fifth voyage.
It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
We don't see ourselves as foolish.
He had comparatively no advantages at first.
He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
I was sick once -- typhoid.
In a way he is my protege.
We are both children together.
It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
Gad, do I remember it.
You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
I can see that knife now.
When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
They robbed me a few years later.
He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
I was completely lost in my work.
His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
Philip dropped back into his chair.
If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
It is growing, every day, every hour.
Now, you understand.
You have associated with some of these men.
And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
He caught himself with a jerk.
How does your wager look now.
He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
The thought set his blood tingling.
But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
It won't be for sale.
For a few moments he ate in silence.
Philip did not pursue the subject.
Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
The flush was gone from her face.
That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
He understood the meaning of the look.
She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
We must achieve our own salvation.
In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
Now it was missing from the wall.
He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
There was no answer from the other side.
Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
It is the nearest refuge.
There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
Your face is red with blood.
Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
He can care for himself.
They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
Until I die, he exclaimed.
Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
I want to die in it.
Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
And yet if she came he had no words to say.
He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
Within himself he called it no longer his own.
Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
I'll only be in the way.
He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
He was sure, now, of but few things.
It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
Such men believe, when they come together.
The journey was continued at dawn.
Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
For two hours not a word passed between them.
I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
Billinger may arrive in time.
There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
I want my men to work by themselves.
Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
Philip bent low over Pierre.
Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
She saw the answer in his face.
Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
There followed a roar that shook the earth.
Blind with rage, he darted in.
In it was the joy of life.
Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
But this little defect did not worry him.
And then, steadily, he began to chew.
Together they ate the rabbit.
They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
It was steel, a fisher trap.
OW, a wild dog, he growled.
He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
That is the strange part of it.
His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
His teeth shut with a last click.
It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
The moon had already begun its westward decline.
They laughed like two happy children.
He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
Fast, but endure.
A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
Then he shouted, Shut up.
He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
To these he gave castor oil.
Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
I'll see to poor Hughie.
Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
Also, I want information.
Let them go out and eat with my boys.
I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
I was in New York when the crash came.
No, I did not fall among thieves.
Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.

Joan cried, with shining eyes.
Nobody knows how the natives got them.
How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
The planters are already considering the matter.
I use great trouble advisedly.

We leave the eventuality to time and law.
I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
Society is shaken to its foundations.
A month in Australia would finish me.
Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.

Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
Let us talk it over and find a way out.
It is a good property, and worth more than that.
I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
The issue was not in doubt.
Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
The President of the United States was his friend.
Your face was the personification of duplicity.
Shorty turned to their employers.
You were engaged.
I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
It was a superb picture.
So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.

At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
You fired me out of your house, in short.
Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
It's worth eight dollars.
And he did hurt my arm.
Saxon's onto her job.
Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
The boy threw back his head with pride.
Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
We could throw stones with our feet.
It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.

Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.

Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.

Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
I play that choice wide open to win.
Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.

Another villain was running for the crossbow, and Dan headed towards him, trying to keep the crossbow out of play.
It's exactly what my father's doing.
When we were leaving, though, he told us to meet him in a neighboring pub after work.
He was standing in front of the hallway.
Had some spell been cast upon him?
Chris had no life.
Where had he left off?
Mike said that it could fling me part way through the city.

The Remozsh looked back at the thing and saw hundreds of forms leaping from the liquid floor, heads, hands, hooves, claws.
Were there any catapults?

Chris walked all around the crate but saw nothing.
curt would have to mortally wound it on the first shot, duck aside, and load another bolt.
Or you can work for a few hours in order to earn shelter.

Wow, that's old.

The illumination would highlight selections of the wall or ceiling for passing moments and then fade before the mind could fully grasp their presence.
" No thank you," said Dan.

What was it?
I waited outside the factory and watched anyone who came and looked around it at night.
The central block jumped up above the rest, stretching the mortar as it leapt.
And then Roy mercifully blacked out.
So what can be done about racism?
Underground home.
But what other alternative was there?
Roy woke up sometime later, after the rain had stopped and stared up into the blackness.
The quest to find Cherry street had begun earlier in the day.
" Sure," she said.
How?
Okay, gotcha.
What could that mean?
I never considered what to do if Mike's murderer were so well placed.
Was something wrong about Chris clothing or face?
It looked to be a nice day, one cheerful enough to dispell the horror of the dream.
I won't be.
Roy looked up and around, the monstrous landscape having been replaced by late afternoon.
Meanwhile, the Ferazi walked over to the place where he dropped his sword and picked up the shining weapon.
This time would show all since it was the first time that someone had come through the door since the sticks were placed.
John spent the first part of the night trying to ascertain the answer to one simple question.
I think we should go right now.
Ted swung his head to look around while Roy's mother held her hands flat against her cheeks in a startled expression.
After all, I had always heard of souls sustaining their earthly residence after death, but had never believed it.
The dream, Roy remembered, where he had seen this was bad.
Soon a thriving city was born into the new world, surpassing the king's grandest expectations, for extensive trading opportunities in extravagant spices and glistening metals soon appeared.
Whenever Roy thought about the subject, perhaps because of all of the stories told to him while he was still small, he began to imagine the monsters underground.
Since it was Roy's turn to follow him, Roy would get to see where the man went-- if it was the same one-- and Ted would go around the whole building checking all of the sticks to see how the man had entered.
Never before had I seen nor read of such a vision, and that is why I so lovingly describe it here, so that the reader may experience the splendor.
he asked.
It wasn't a humming sound though, but was more of a low rumble which John felt rather than heard.
" Look at the rocks jutting from that hillside," Mike would point out.
Disgusting.
Roy could see part of the man's cheek and a thin head of glowing hair illuminated backlit by the lantern.
The bolt sprang from the crossbow.
The Ferazi are cunning fighters, and the bloody conflict lasted a long time;
With enough clandestine help, the two cut throats would pull each other down.
It wasn't a very great leap to make, but he never had any need to consider the problem before, so he never realized the difference and always assumed that Humans saw exactly the same as he did.
" But, you also knew that I might find out.
He stood up and answered," Jars.
When I ran down stairs I could find no one.
From the path that the man took, Roy could tell than the man had come from a flight of stairs that remained barely illuminated by the receding light.
I'll say.
The Remozsh interrupted," Ted saw them take Mike.
" Well," said Dan," we don't exactly know that.
zack jumped aside and landed in the dirt.
So, John accepted and promised Chris that he'd be the first one to get blamed if anything went wrong.
Did he come in the house that way?
I know who you talked to.
We can meet at John's place in three hours.
Both Dan and John skipped out of work just after noon and went to Mike's apartment since they had no clues to go on except for a few rotting bodies left underground;
" Good," said the red haired man loudly.
" Maybe we'll just leave him be and give up.
The room that they had entered was enormous, but it was dwarfed by its contents, not because the room's contents were physically larger, but because mentally they were harder to fathom.
Now that the group was actually faced with the gate, they were forced to figure out what to do about it.
I arranged my uncle's suit of armor into human form and shaped a straw body to go within the shell.
But, this time, when Dan went around the corner, he saw that the stairs met bottom only meters away.
Yeah.
I didn't know that the ferazi ever attacked inviroth.
Although he couldn't identify the initial sounds, he heard the familiar footsteps.
Look, it's Roy!
Dan didn't think that she read, but then John remembered hearing Susan talking about reading to herself.
Zack heard Curt scrambling around behind him but wasn't exactly sure what his friend was doing and definitely wasn't going to take his eyes off of the looming Ferazi.
He's a member of the Wizard's guild.
Zack paused and looked around ominously.
and man did she have huge.
Maybe the wizards just fooled everyone into thinking they were powerful magicians and then got wealthy using their clever trickery.
The wizard's voice echoed in a thunderous chorus.
John obeyed Dan's orders, walked over to the two doors at the end of the hall assigned to him and tried opening the one on the left.
I live in a middle class neighborhood.
I will return in a two weeks.
If John and he were to quit the case and return to their former professions, then Dan would inevitably be forced to follow his father's business.
Mike was dead.
Mike had understood the translation this time.
So what might you be up to?
I later learned that most Ferazi have white fur over their entire body, though they aren't albinos because their eyes are colored.
Relying upon past experience, Todd knew that if he got up now the Ferazi would hit him right away.
The smile widened but gained no depth.
Roy's leader did this for about half an hour until suddenly, just as night was falling, he disappeared, almost from right in front of Roy.
I am very tempted to award the prize to this one, but since I must be impartial, my judgment will have to wait until I've seen all of my other cases.
Caylan had known then that the man was not alone, as he had claimed, but was working as part of a larger group.
I didn't enter any game and I never knew I might die.
From up here you can see everything.
All of them tried their utmost to keep their head above the black death and occasionally making a futile lunge to escape.
Everyone in the city would know that magic was used and instantly point a finger at the Wizard's guild which wasn't even legally supposed to have an office in Inviroth.
I bet ya talked to Brenda.
After all, there are lots of security companies around who provide defense.
Dan then let the muscles pull the bone in place and looked at his work.
Chris even peeked underneath the bed but saw nothing.
This entry here, is from about two weeks ago.
Oh, okay.
I vaulted into and shattered through the window, like a fairy spreading magical dust before himself.
They were just people.
Business picked up as soon as Lloyd's first notes were passed out and sign hung, attracting an extensive variety of occupations, cultures, and personalities, but all of the clientele looking for the same atmosphere to relax.
but now, after several more hours of rummaging through old memories, Roy's attentions were alerted.
Clothes don't need replacement very often.
After the third time Dan heard someone grumble, some sheets swish, and footsteps walk towards the door.
Caylan would only have to place them in a strategic location, most likely the governor's chambers or near some other official of the Thieves' guild.
Another dramatic pause.
It was useless to climb higher.
But what if the wizard kept him down in this dungeon forever?
He looked into the nearby doorways but all of them were locked and he had heard neither a door opening nor closing.
none of the foretold beasts noticed Roy sitting alone and trapped in the dark.
Chapter twelve
John had no idea what the Ferazi was doing so he just stood and watched the rabbit, wondering what the crazy thing was about to do.
It took a second for Dan to fathom why Ted wanted a sword.
Why wait?
Huh?
They didn't even use any bits, but had a simple leather harness tied around the horse's nose.
Although Roy had never seen any magic before, beyond the card tricks of magicians in the street, this all seemed familiar, as though Roy had watched this particular show before.
That didn't help their predicament much, especially since they needed Chris to read the diary for them so that they could finish the work they started.
No Ferazi or human has entered them since, and many suspect that over the course of two thousand years they have all collapsed.
I'm not coming down.
The three crept down the stairs and towards the cage, staying close to the wall all of the time.
Evidently, the distraction made Roy forget what he was going to say since Roy shut his mouth.
Chris followed, almost blindly, occasionally peeking back at the man to see if he had moved an arm or turned his head.
Chris had to know how many people were down in the cellar.
He'd rather relax and savor the time.
Zack didn't want to imagine what the monster was doing to his friend, and hoped that he'd die before he found out.
Jong, always the proper one, sat on the room's only chair, propped up against the closed bedroom door.
You're right about that.
scott went about his work of getting the beer, completely oblivious to the ferazi, and returned with one in hand only seconds later.
I'll write up fifty copies of this by tomorrow and then you can post them up.
Roy, standing between the three silent thinkers, turned around, looking from its furry relative in white, getting no sympathy, then to Dan, again no entertainment, and finally to John, which it saw was staring right at itself.
Dan pushed off the fear.
Dan would inevitably consider the possibility of John's insanity but he'd give his friend the benefit of the doubt.
Would anyone read a fiction to whose entirety they were already aware and whose chapters were written in such a monotonous voice that it was painful to read even a page?
But if the Ferazi had told Mike of his dealings in Inviroth, what would Mike say?
He was all covered but I noticed that he was tall, and seemed to be an albino, at least from a quick glance at his face.
What do you think of your parents?
Half bare footed, I winced down the prickly foliage and found my way home, where I spent the rest of the day picking out thorns.
Within a few hours I was safely concealed in front of the window to the master bedroom, just in time to see the master empty his bed for the day.
Roy tried to scream but his voice refused to let anymore out then a small whisper, and then turned over and crawled away from the claw as quickly as he could.
Actually, he could, he just didn't want to believe it.
Nothing else was there.
Shrouded in a flowing white gown was a pristine lady with lovely eyes and hair as black as the night.
Stupidest thing John had ever done.
And this is my life, and I'm very good at it.
As he recalled, the magic was not fool proof and the victim might escape alive, which certainly would not happen with any of the less discrete approaches, but it did not leave any magical traces.
Mike didn't believe it.
In fact, Roy thought, the iron cage would protect him from any monster lurking underground.
Mike had never been far from the city.
Dan pulled the sheets off of his bead and spread them on the floor just in case the creature had somehow hidden within the folds of the fabric.
At first he tried to squeeze through the bars but only managed to get himself stuck, making him even more panicked because now the monsters could catching him while he was immobile.
They are black, sinister, and have a glazed stare which continually focuses on emptiness, as though they see another world unimaginable to us.
But you end up going to different places.
Roy, not having any possessions, did not have much of a need for storage, and as for sleeping, on frigid or rainy nights he would sleep at work or walk around shivering until morning.
Sliding a bit more, Roy grabbed the first rung with his hands, and then he realize thar for the first time in his life, he was wholly underground.
His friend was good with weapons but not that good.
" It was about this big," said Roy as he held out his hands," and made of wood.
Susan sniffed and then perused back through a about twenty more pages without finding anything.
" You've known me for awhile.
There ain't no such thing.
He was too afraid that the trail of lights would end or suddenly extinguish themselves though, so he kept the candle in hand.
However, I must admit that I an unable to ferret one out, or even invent a plausible excuse for a moral.
Caylan stood up right and returned a very icy stare.
What're those?
he was very good at this and had gone many years without losing a man, until one day fall, while half of the leaves still clung to the trees, zack's grandfather and his troop were ambushed by the ferazi.
However, due to some unfortunate circumstances, Caylan had been forced to replace his loyal men and had done the best job he could with only a day or two to react.
He held up his hands in attempt to calm the Ferazi and stepped back.
Are you going to be quiet this time?
Just before he reached the bottom, John also made a mental note that he was also following a sword wielding rabbit, probably the most dangerous thing down here, into its hole.
zack watched intently and mike began talking to the ferazi and was amazed when the thing began talking back to mike in its hoarse, almost whispering voice.
Controlling, or perhaps only inciting this distortion of nature, was a tiny wizard in the far left corner of the room.
a group of people were huddled around him and began asking him if he was alright when they saw that he was conscious.
by Derek Halfstar.
he began to make plans for dealing with the rabbit.
The Ferazi lowered himself down the well and disappeared.
I waited for Lady Catherine's ghost to show itself, not knowing whether to be frightened or amazed at such a feat.
Dan watched her walk over to the bar and get the drinks poured by the barkeep, who seemed to carefully measure how much drink he allotted to each glass.
Roy had never been in a dungeon before, but that was because he never desired the experience enough to get himself locked in one, nor did he know where any were, except for the one underneath the castle.
Perhaps he was an evil sorcerer gone to visit his henchmen in the underground and he had created a magical fire so that he could creep down the hole into the underworld and not be taken away by its inhabitants.
It might be fun, watching it squirm, or maybe being awed by Caylan's intellect and perception.
ideally the skin would be taken and hung, but this only happened if the beast were caught away from the protection of the warren or if its neighbors failed to wake up.
Be prepared to climb up the ladder.
Go away.
A bit more exploration would reveal some more carvings or maybe some old clothing.
I didn't ask yet.
Completely out of options for escape, Roy retreated to the back of his cage and curled up, hoping to avoid the notice of and wandering monsters.
A look of frustration overcame her.
Unable to maintain his current position under the stress, Roy gave way and looked up at the approaching monster.
No one spoke for a moment.
Chapter eight
Roy was sure of that.
Luckily he didn't fall down.
He was wearing a ratty old shirt and pants, just enough to keep him warm at night underneath his sheets.
Of course, being a budding gentleman, I would relieve the dummy for a few hours every day and place myself in its role.
Snakes?
Furthermore, here he was entering a wizard's dungeon.
The prisoner flinched.
How does this tempt the reader to continue?
Concluding that this was a message from the heavens, I began my walk back to my own bed, beyond the wall.
Perhaps a painting or servant?
zack decided that he didn't want to bring todd on the next hunt, and more so, didn't ever want to see him again.
After the underground scene, Chris found himself in his bed, having just woken up from his previous nightmare, a dream wrapped within a dream.
Chris body lay in its pool of blood.
Chris, feeling relieved that the combat was traversing more to form, continued the cliche, pushing hard against the man and then withdrawing the weapon.
Caylan put down the pen that he had unconsciously picked up and fingered while he was thinking, sat back and relished the comfort of the arm chair.
The two looked at each other.
Two crossbow men stood with their weapons loaded and aimed directly at the trio.
This wasn't a likely scenario because of the barking guard dogs, a large mansion to search through, and who knows how many people patrolling the insides.
Don't know roads.
All these questions and more, did I have waiting and ready to ask them.
Paul didn't manage to stoke the fire with as much relish or flare as he usually did, not particularly caring about his image tonight, and too bored to even practice it.
What if Dan's visit permanently ruined Roy's chances of freedom?
Oh my darling.
The great Danes which, with aloof stride, paraded the grounds insuring that no creature larger than a mole would taste the fruits of the garden, leaving the flowers to be enjoyed by the birds, gathering bees, and the mansions' protective owners.
One guy did, and I followed him to a warehouse about fifteen minutes away.
Not wishing to lose my long awaited opportunity, I jumped onto my horse and began chasing the Ferazi, far in front of my lagging comrades.
Ted had turned a corner and couldn't be seen.
We would have traveled on the path forever if the good farmer had not pointed out that our light supply was getting low, and we were forced to return to the surface.
He held his hand outside the cage for his captor to shake.
Well, he was making plans to take care of it, and he knew exactly where it lived.
Each time, the same man with light blond hair and fairly well to do clothing came out of the warehouse, and went off on an errand.
Everything else seemed to be the same as it was before he had seen the monster.
What do you see?
Chris was horrified at what he had done, and removed his blade from the man, whose wound began gushing blood once the cork was released.
Ferazi built only a few different things, a few different tools for cooking, some for farming, a couple more for war fare, and several for horses, probably no more than a hundred different types of tools, weapons, and other hand made constructions in totals.
The Ferazi was weakly conscious, staring upwards and breathing in short gasps of air.
He heard the sword land with a clatter several meters up the hall.
Where am I?
Once he had attained any of his goals, Caylan had always found their luster to tarnish as the victory wore thin and the monotony of his new position grew.
Chris looked around and found another Ferazi, this one sitting on a chair just outside a door, about twenty meters away.
The servants have told me that he places her painting over mine when I'm gone.
They know that there' re monsters underground.
I can say that I don't really know, but I've got some guesses.
Every branch had a group of transitory leaves to be abandoned in the fall, but which now waged shadowy war on their cousin branch's colony of leaves.
I'm sure of it.
Did ya read all those?
Zack ignored the joke.
Unfortunately, there weren't any to be found.
John pushed on the far end of the board to raise the the opposite end, slipped his fingers underneath the slight crack which was opened up, and lifted out the board.
John parried the saucer with his sword but it only deflected the object away from his head and into his shoulder.
I don't even think he's a wizard since he doesn't do anything.
So what do you need us for?
once the door was kicked down and the rabbit awaken, it would grab its weapon, either a sword or spear, and either jump out the window and attack the hunters from behind, or it would charge blindly through the door.
He thinks that it's shipped over seas.
It is my duty, enlisted by the before mentioned party, to examine the sculptures and paintings of the manors of this fore mentioned city.
Look at what we've got here.
If you're ever in a bind, stop by our headquarters.
Uh huh.
Do you know where he lives or works?
Something made a shuffling sound off to Roy's left, about ten meters away.
Thus I recommend to you: Drink well and dine heartily at Lloyd's, but do not, under any circumstances, eat the food.
You insult me.
He took his own bolt and loaded it into the crossbow, and then walked cautiously up to the body.
The shield was nearly cut in half.
All you need to know is what berries, leaves, and roots are safe to eat.
I'm fed up with what I'm doing, and if I thought I'd be at the same place the rest of my life I'd waste away just like Ferazi.
Where did the dream start?
Not knowing what else to do, Dan obliged.
no one had an immediate answer.
Or was the liquid really red, only appearing black because of the light?
Surprisingly, John said," Sure, why the hell not.
My father has been hauling junk his entire life and if I stay here I'm gonna be doing the exact same stuff.
He then sewed and bandaged his future friend up, and spent the next month caring for the recuperating Ferazi.
I don't know about you, but I'm lucky that I can speak with my sister, and that I get along with my parents.
Of course, trades guild members are infuriated by the heretical factories, and they would have thwarted the enterprise before its conception if it were not the Emperor's decree.
Dan was the first to climb, followed by John, who was forced to carry the Ferazi's heavy armor and cape up with him.
zack turned around and made sure that the ferazi was still there.
zack immediately grabbed the crossbow with both hands and tried to wrench it from todd's hands.
he yelled.
You're not gonna go down there, are you?
Everyone was silent for a minute.
The feet, devoid of shoes, were covered with mud, coloring the sickly white fur brown.
This provided me with ample reason to speed the battle to its ultimate course, my victory, which I never failed to win.
Zack raised his chair and blocked the steel, allowing it to sever one of the chair's cross supports rather than his head.
But, as he waited to die, Zack's strength slowly returned, and when it had regrouped enough, Zack's morale returned and he decided to fight for his life and kill the rabbit.
Of course, answering why racism exists will answer the second question.
No questions.
The Remozsh took a few quick looks around the room and interrupted," Where's Chris?
Look what you've done!
He suggested that some sort of mark be put on them to indicate if they had been opened or not, perhaps a stick leaning at an angle against the exit;
I have never seen a Ferazi wear shoes, but I suppose that their craftsmen are unable to make such long and flexible soles.
That was all that he knew how to do, move large bags and packages around the city from sunrise to sunset.
Run and get Chris.
More can be learned from a mug of beverage than a hundred dollars stuffed into a man's pocket in the market, or a like tribute given in a temple, and above all you will more often than not leave as friends.
John took a few seconds of searching to find the correct spot, but when he finally identified the correct board, with the dent in the corner and slightly rounded edges, it was just as he had left it, untouched by anyone else.
The glow from behind the Ferazi slowly faded as he escaped.
zack and curt would spend the nights playing cards or just shooting the breeze, their visits ending only when the hag beat her broom handle in her ceiling in order to get zack and curt to shut up.
Have you ever had a human invite ya into his home?
Oh" was Roy's only response.
Since I have so often shown Inviroth through occasional anecdotal fragments, and never through a proper looking glass large enough to reflect the city's scope, I devote this chapter to the construction of a larger mirror, although I fear that even if I were to devote a book towards illuminating Inviroth, the constructed mirror of words would still be far too small to experience the aggregate splendor of the reality.
I'll tell you what.
Because Mike ask me.
The Ferazi then coiled up the rope and gave it to Dan, who accepted it without complaint.
Once again I inquired where his home was, but rather than pointing to any section of the map, he rudely glared at me, eyes filled with intense hatred, even more than they had displayed before.
He might even lead Roy into more clues useful to Mike's investigation, especially since he seemed to be paying Jim.
The closet's floor had disappeared and revealed a stone stairway leading down underneath the mansion.
which left the problem of finding where it lived, or more immediately, of convincing mike to tell zack where it lived.
zacks head was ripped backwards as his hair was grabbed by a claw.
Well, because her mother said so, and so did here grandmother.
Except for the prisoner's tied hands, his over all posture gave Chris the impression of a meditation trance.
I returned the next evening with a clever idea stashed away in a sack.
Dan and John sat silently at the table until the still un named manager came in, watching the crowd increase as people got off of work and made their way to the pub to meet with their friends and enjoy life.
She scowled.
It's initiative was copied by the other knights and before long all of the suits were moving.
The albino didn't know when the theft would happen, but told Mike's manager not to let it happen.
" No" said zack with much effort," I didn't say it.
His mother had sent him into the human city, in essence, to wage war against its human inhabitants and discover their weaknesses.
Why didn't Dan and John follow suit and likewise let the ship sink?
The rabbit knew about this all along but didn't bother telling anyone.
Susan sniffed and then perused back through about twenty more pages without finding anything that she was willing to read.
Caylan was not certain about what he would do once he became governor and did not exactly know what or why he wanted it.
Well, Dan did miss it, no matter how obvious the street was supposed to be.
Chris was unable to see any footprints diverge from the path, so he followed it with his lantern straight into the center of the room where it ended with a series of bonded boards, probably the top of a crate.
And furthermore, every object has an obvious use or it wouldn't be constructed.
Dan didn't have the lying ability necessary to talk his way out, but he'd have to quell the wizard's mistrust anyhow.
hell, they were never here, just imaginations of a half baked writer.
There were even a lot of animals in the floor which I never heard of.
See Mike.
Dan enjoyed the sun for another moment before he trekked off to Garden Street.
Could Chris explain that they were in mortal combat fighting to save someone's life, and to do so had to take several others in the process?
" Look behind you," he said, and the wizard motioned with his free arm.
Last is tunnel going other place.
" Look," said chris, defending his idea," all we did was to talk to some bartenders and ask around to see if they had encountered anything like that.
Although the reader probably doesn't care, we even learned a little about the elusive Remozsh during our stay.
He wondered if he should go down into the cellar and toy with the Remozsh, ask it a few questions of idle chat, maybe even see if it really knew anything about why it was assigned to its post.
Chris' adrenaline was rushing because he was excited about the change in his lifestyle which this moment represented, and even though the past few days seemed to be filled with branches in life's highway, Chris knew that he stood in front of an enormous and abrupt division of the road which would take him someplace completely new.
Zack continued to give russ half a minute of the silence treatment before paul interrupted and attempted to change the subject.
John mad himself look busy and checked the padlock, hoping that it really was locked.
John was bolting towards a thug on the right, who was reciprocating the charge with an up raised sword.
My mother told me never to go underground because there are bad things.
A bit of blood trickled from his mouth.
well your clothes.
What d' you want to do?
If I can find out who it is, or prevent the theft, then maybe they'll promote me.
When he got halfway down he gave up and just let himself fall, anticipating that one impact with the ground would hurt a lot less than hundreds of thorns.
John would play a game with himself, looking over people when he first met them, watching them for a few minutes, and then guess at a personality.
Ha!
Dan could hear his laboured breathing, but Dan didn't know how long he would live.
Ill" was the beast way that Dan could put it, with" strange" following a close second.
This whole landscape is populated, at the extremities, by the suburban middle class, spending their free time in their back yard, or driving on the highways to reach their local mall or work place.
Chris walked away from his parent's house, the buildings and people sliding past his hurried stride.
Hey wake up Roy.
Hey, stop that!
All of the descriptions of Ferazi which I had widely out of old time soldiers were only approximations to the real creatures.
You realize, of course, that you won't be able to get him arrested.
Just like fifteen years ago, Dan felt as though his older brother was daring him, a young kid, to enter a pitch black room which creaked and danced in anticipation of its tender victim.
Ted waved goodbye and started to walk away.
Dan considered this really odd since he'd expected some sort of remark about Roy from that last sentence.
Maybe Dan could put a good spin on it and claim that the two were turning the journal over to Susan because Mike was her brother.
Trying to look insulted, I waved the prize ribbon about and spewed forth an excuse.
What else could Roy do?
As he slid across the surface, Zack's boots caught hold of the table's rim and carried it along with his own momentum.
Susan's mother let them in the back room.
such ferazi mentality forced the humans to be likewise bloody and prevent any ferazi from escaping, for an escaped rabbit would hold the grudge and hunt down his combatant until one of them died.
He decided then and there that next week he'd try to get into the temple.
Ted thought a moment," Or be fed ta his wolves.
Not wishing to get into any more trouble than they already were, both Dan and John obeyed, and moved away from the horse.
That happened to be a Ferazi wearing a roughly woven tunic with some sort of animal shapes on, who was packing a horse with several bags.
He should have opened the gate.
The bed, however, was flipped over and had its belly torn apart, scattering stuffing throughout the room.
Live here no one now.
Humans don't like us very much either.
He did know that some guild official of the Organization was cozying up to the Emperor for the position, and had been fairly successful in his groveling, gaining permission from the Emperor to open up several more factories in Inviroth.
" Who are you talking about?
He stopped-- Roy expected him to say something-- but instead the visitor deposited his own lamp and picked up Roy's.
Everything there was old and rotten, and any food which may have been appetizing was always soiled by the stench of carrion, making it wholly unappetizing.
Unfortunately, neither of them had enough courage to stay too long in the warehouse, Roy fearing some sort of magic-- which Ted and Mike denied-- and Ted worried about what would happen if they found something.
Either way, Chris decided that he must act as normal as possible, but he couldn't remember what his daily routine was, what expression he normally wore, or how he typically walked.
" shut up" commanded zack, being in no mood for pauls jokes
The wizard answered in a subconscious and distant voice, like a preoccupied parent does to a child," That's nice.
Roy's knees bent and his back hit the hedge.
I have to rescue Mike.
Susan gasped-- Chris hadn't even noticed her come in. He hoped that the carnage wouldn't affect her too much.
He had always noticed a different look on such people, something maddening, which called out danger signs to him.
Yet adults would deny they had ever mentioned the beasts when it came time for the child to sleep in a dark room.
These deformed and hid the fundamental structure.
Mike, of course, shrugged it off and did not care if he were seen with a" rabbit.
it asked, changing the subject slightly.
They threw my first gift in the mud, failed to thank me for my second, hence stealing it, shredded apart my map, and rode away without the least parting gesture.
Instead, the Remozsh turned his attention to the present moment and the duty that lay ahead of him.
Wizard Caylan had one of the largest collections of literature, science, mathematics, and history in Inviroth, which undoubtedly meant that his collection was challenged by few others in the Western Empire.
She said something in a voice too quiet to hear, and after a moment, walked back down the stairs and out.
Roy stood up and backed away from the pit and wondered what he could do about his predicament.
Paul figured that it was Pete trying to sneak in without waking Paul up, just in case Paul was asleep, which he wasn't.
Of course, if they were well armed then the odds would be closer.
Since the failed encounter resulted from no error in my socialization, the Ferazi must be a crude people.
Looking down onto Roy, Caylan said," I'm going to do some magic soon, so if you have any more questions you had better get them out now.
What happens if Mike isn't hallucinating, what then?
As my discoveries would later prove to the world, the Remozsh had come from the underground, fleeing in a mass exodus from some sort of real or imagined threat, into our world, and as far as anyone knows, there are no more Remozsh underground.
It was Chris who took the first slashes at his enemy's chest.
Please, bear with me, and let me demonstrate to you the proofs as I experienced them, so that you too will be convinced.
" Come over here and let me give you a hug," she said and held out her arms.
My eyes were momentarily transfixed, body stunned, and mind numbed by her beauty.
Roy had not seen where they came from because he was just sleeping and subsequently engrossed in his conversation with Ted.
Since the Ferazi had arrived, about fifteen minutes ago, John had engaged into another staring contest with it and won, several times in fact.
He either didn't think that Roy was listening or assumed that Roy couldn't hear.
Several more ripples originated from various points in the pentagram.
From this intersection the touring man has the enormously difficult selection of heading east towards the port, or west into the heart of the city.
Chris gave no response.
Rather than let the good reader think that I am blood thirsty or even begin to imagine that I had plans for combating the Ferazi after the good Emperor had declared an end to the war, I must explain my eagerness.
Again, the stoic figure gave no answer.
Paul realized that the Ferazi as it was in mid air, lunging right for Paul, and all that Paul could think was," Wow!
Lloyd's is a haven for traders and adventurers from the great forest, and those who have recently departed from their ships and are heading west.
Of course they would, and millions of them did and will.
I find two reasons for not returning on the morrow to the manor.
We have to get Roy back;
Zag doubted than Scott had any friends at all, except for the bottles behind his bar.
There were enough people that they took care of Jim and his three men.
Maybe it was Zack.
The butler lead me into a large hall in which many a colored canvas were hung.
John worried that Dan was getting too serious about unearthing the dead guy's murderer, considering it's solution to be some sort of salvation.
Oh, so you know them.
The enemy shifted his sword left and parried the blow.
That could get depressing.
He might just be unconscious.
it seemed easy enough to roy, especially since mike would supply him with food.
Chris continued to make his escape although he didn't know where his hiding place would lie, but randomly crept through the alleys and road ways, affecting turns by any whim that overtook him.
If things were that simple then there'd be thousands of people wandering around like that, and there aren't.
" Caylan paused and smiled," Nothing you need to be concerned about.
The Remozsh started rummaging around the room, opening and closing drawers.
The humans dislike the Ferazi and the Remozsh, while the Ferazi gladly reciprocate.
Roy was captured by Caylan while watching his house.
A minute later, one end of the rope flew over the ledge and landed next to John.
He was even more whacked than Chris.
I wish Chris were here.
After about a week underground, while the very same cavern, we encountered a curious race which welcomed us into their village, a small hamlet constructed within an enormous cavern.
So you're still in then?
All of this can be gotten with the aid of a well tipped guardsman.
At the opposite end of the circular room were some wooden crates, blankets, and an extinct fire with surrounded by a ring of stones and an iron kettle hanging over it.
From where he lay, Zack could only see the Ferazi's head because the table and chair blocked most of his view.
But," Mike emphasized this with an upraised finger," I have hope.
He mixed the red and blue together.
They still might have been though, since anyone down there had a good chance of hearing roy's exclamation.
Anticipating some vessel of adventure I bolted down the stairs and introduced myself to a most stunning vial of beauty.
Buy why?
The black haired one yelled in a whisper at his friend.
all in all it was a pretty sweet deal and roy was excited to get to his post.
Since Ted was not here yet, he found a substitute in more scenery.
That was an easy one to follow.
Even though this story does not immediately concern Inviroth, it has a significant effect upon the city, and, even more so, is an excellent tale and important for the historian to know.
Roy felt disappointed, not so much that he had guessed the wrong name, but because" Jim" was so boring.
Roy's imagination would would dub them to be one of these heroes, and then the Remozsh would follow the icons all day to see if they lived up to his expectations, and if they really were the denizens of books.
No good.
He was a human who was a hair shy of a Remozsh's personality.
The magic had retreated years ago as Dan's awareness of reality overpowered magic's allure.
I think I can get promoted, save some money, and then I'm outta this town.
When I get done, and think that I've got him on my side, I start asking about the one eared rabbit, and saying how dangerous it is, and how it has to be taken care of, just like a dog with rabies.
Roy followed the man the first time when he walked down to the market and bought some food and beer, at least a week or two's worth by Roy's estimate.
Their armoring technology is definitely ages behind our own, their mail being of large crudely made links without rivets;
Roy silently walked down the narrow hallway, but stopped just before he reached the bend, wondering if the villain was waiting on the other side of the bend, ready to grab Roy as he walked around.
But the only possible torture devices were the lamps, randomly scattered in the middle of the room, and their flames wouldn't even make Roy scream, although it would hurt to be burned.
the blade was still sharp and unchipped since he hadn't had to use it against armor for awhile and since it was of very good steal.
The supervisor looked around and considered the idea, but then decided against it.
When the group had hiked down to the bottom of the hill, about half way to Dan's apartment, Dan's weary brain was rudely awakened.
Roy took a few seconds to scan the street to see if there was any help on its way, but it was fairly empty and the few people who were passing seemed disinterested.
Ah," I said.
And if he was lucky, Dan would walk out of Inviroth a rich man.
After everyone had left, Dan closed the apartment door and made his way up to the front of the line where Chris, Susan, and the Remozsh were talking.
I told ya it wouldn't work.
I've done that several times and I'm a Ferazi- The farmer would try to kill me if he found me, the worst he would do to you is throw you out.
They would have to be saved likewise.
He merely stared coolly at me rather than volunteer even a word, even after I had pointed to my self and said," Me Derek Halfstar," and prompted him by pointing his way and asking," And you?
Luckily, the wizard had enough magical protection that he did not need them to keep him safe.
Ted had been waiting all night for Roy to arrive, and was elated when his friend showed up with Chris and a large supply of food which Chris had picked up on the way over.
He answered his statement," We cant finish this even with Chris.
Bring me her name and I will pay you with this," and has smoothly as she had spoken, her glove revealed a beautiful gemstone worth not less than several years of my previous non adventuring labor.
It was beautiful.
Uh uh.
Unfortunately, the wizard did not know the man's name or he could have quickly silenced the man.
The wizard then bent over and began to paint in broad strokes what seemed to be line, but Roy's view was obscured by the wizard's robes swishing back in forth in contrary motion to the brush.
During the day, everyone is forced to do hard labor from sun rise to sun down, most often for someone else's gain.
Certain that the bed would soon to become platter, he used his only defense to ward of the steel sharpened claws of the monsters, and pulled his wool blanket over his head.
Roy could barely hear anything and definitely could not understand any of the conversation.
" Okay, lets pick' im up and walk him out' ve here.
But what if there were other humans of Mike's qualities, those that would save a dying Ferazi at the risk of their own lives?
Roy actually knew something about what everyone was talking about, and since he knew the most about it, he decided to break in." Yeah, Zack was asking where you lived but Mike wouldn't tell him.
Russ handed Zack another card, a six this time.
Zack smirked.
I whipped out the pad of paper which I happened to possess.
Roy jerked the bed and looked like he was about to talk, but the Remozsh halted and turned his head and shoulders quickly around to face John.
The man, however, smiled slightly and looked down to the wound.
It actually did something, if looking out a pitch black window could be considered a rational action.
John's problem hinged on which side the Ferazi actually took though.
But why are they down there?
All of the other Remozsh that Roy knew had been told similar stories.
Chris looked down and saw that a worn path of footprints travelled from the doorway to the center of the room.
Ted, how many people did you see take Mike in?
Zack then sat up so that he could see what shape his legs were in and if they table trapped them.
Dan still didn't have any firm way to convince Caylan to let Roy go.
Roy watched for a couple of seconds, and when Roy was certain that the three were aimed for his friend he yelled," Hey Ted!
But it was most likely a waste of time talking to the creature, and Caylan would get nothing more than babble out of its mouth.
Look, we're not gonna hurt ya.
Although at first Inviroth resisted the expansion of the Empire, its rulers ultimately perceived the wisdom of such a bond, and although they lost a degree of self-control, the defense and prosperity brought about by the Empire countered the weight.
Looks like he's in a world of hurt.
Rather than returning the kindness, all five looked at one another as if confused.
Its dying fire softly lit the dark room and threw dancing shadows against the walls.
Not wishing to sleep with an animal, cat or not, Dan leapt out of bed.
Having lived in Inviroth for my entire life and never having seen an Emph Kelzar there, I cannot believe that the guild would be controlling the factories.
but just before he sat down he remembered the shutter which he had seen hanging on a window next to the door.
How many people have said to you that they want to keep the" race pure.
The room fell silent, more quiet than when Bob and Charlie had gotten into a knife fight a few months back.
All the while Roy screamed," No, let me go.
Neither Dan nor John were especially eager to search them.
So then how could John prove that he wasn't crazy?
I have spent a good part of my life as a white male, the supposed perpetrators of racism, sexism, and all else that is bad with the world.
this time all eyes on his table were glaring at zack and seemed to reiterate what the mouths had just said.
He got up, standing very erect and aloof, picked up the box under one arm, and strode up Garden Street.
If he could just dispell that into self defence he'd be fine.
While waiting, Chris noted that his foe was a man of about thirty with greasy, unkempt hair, sun tanned and wrinkled skin, with black eyes.
She then changed the subject," You are boring me.
But her friends will and they told me all.
He didn't seem to get our message," said Ron.
Since they were meeting outside Inviroth, Mike rummaged around for a fallen branch.
Chris felt that something was wrong and wondered if there were a few sneaking in the shadows preparing for a rear assault.
Man does she have the hots for you," and accentuated by pointing.
Was it worth living such an existence, a life more predictable and monotonous than poorly conceived fiction?
There was more rustling along with the occasional expletive.
Susan discovered Mike missing a few days later and hired us.
I ask the reader to recall any animal he's seen with rabies, or which is almost starved to death, and to apply the animal's look to the imagined Ferazi's head.
Using more common and banal words, I asked if any of them understood my language.
The Ferazi stopped, perked up its ears, and listened, several times, but each time would continue on towards the house after hearing nothing.
John sleepily answered," Yeah.
Come with your sword and armor.
The monster vanished.
Zack was sitting at the bar, which is unusual, because he always sits in the corner.
He quietly inched his way to the left side of his cage, where he braced himself against an assault by some nameless beast.
Dan knew that it wasn't even a bad dream since he almost never had any dreams.
After having watched the butcher for a good long time, and having gotten to know the butcher's personality as well as could be without actually having met him, roy's stomach began to growl and hunger began to creep from its hiding place and invade roy's body and then finally his thoughts.
Opposite him was the rabbit, sitting on one of the chairs which Dan had borrowed from his neighbor.
The two walked through a short passage into a domed chamber about six meters across carved from stone.
Was Dan's reasoning really a good enough excuse, that it was kill or be killed?
Even though the past few days seemed to be filled with forks in life's highway, Chris knew that he stood in front of an enormous and abrupt division of the road which would take him someplace completely new.
Although Chris' last swing pulled his sword too far back to be effective, his shield blocked the swing, getting a chip cut out of it.
John had an odd look on his face which Dan couldn't fully identify.
the remozsh just resigned himself to watching the door all night, hoping that the occasionally rain drop which landed on his head wouldn't turn into a torrent.
John got onto his stomach, reached underneath the bed, and pulled the object out.
Roy forced himself to believe that it been one of the later two since Roy wouldn't allow the first one to be a possibility.
Would you like a plate of our roast beef?
If Roy had not walked up the steep hill, he would have surmised that the remnants of the trees and bricks lay broken at the bottom.
Propped against a large stones was the burning torch, with a bundle of black cloth, the cloak which the perpetrator was wearing, near by.
But even if you need meat, you can buy a bow and arrows for a few hundred dollars.
Sine the Ferazi commander was being so close mouthed I took it upon myself to describe a brief synopsis of my own history and philosophies.
Chris was glad that he was being so cautious when he noticed, about six steps down, a spot of blood which must have dripped from his sword when he climbed up the stairs last night.
It wouldn't be long before he fell asleep and woke up to find the sun intruding upon his window again.
I thought we killed that months ago.
The wizard took no notice of Roy's injured feelings and continued his perusal of the books.
John loosened the nose even more and then began pulling it up over his head.
All he could hear, see, smell, taste, and feel were the thunderous words of the wizard.
russ' room probably had hundreds of holes in it by now, from all of the times he fired a bolt.
And who says not?
mike said that some people had stolen something from his work and that he thought that their hideout was in the warehouse.
Of course, he checked it first just to make sure that he could not see the circles himself.
" Go I. Listen I. Get Mike I." Chris noticed that the Ferazi heads in the doorways had disappeared.
He merely watched the illumination and studied its brilliantly obscured features.
Roy yelled to the wizard.
Well Mike doesn't have to work every other sunday.
And of course, the rabbits were forced into ghettos because they were too dangerous to be around people, but not only that.
The money had been entrusted to him so that he could complete his task in Inviroth.
John grabbed a hold of the mug and pulled it towards him.
Roy and ted did this, monitoring them every hour but the sticks had remained in exactly the same position.
The humans killed all of the grass and trees, put in mud and cobblestone roads, and then erected tall buildings of tar covered timbers, twigs, and mud.
Roy fainted.
Yeah right.
But this was John's room, so he opened the door further, and not knowing what he'd discover, John peeked into his old room.
The building was one large shell, framed with large timbers covered with pitch, and filled in with wattle and daub.
The Remozsh refused so my friends and I picked him up and proceeded to carry him down the stairs into my uncle's wine cellar, but the creature grew frantic and managed to escape, leaving deep scratches on all of us.
Dan's eyes expected some legs, bent knees, or even a hole which enabled half of the thing to reside below ground.
he spent about a second worrying about suck matter but abandoned the thoughts as too trivial in such a situation.
Chris hated living without and sense of wonder or accomplishment.
Awe.
Oh, they may try.
Consequently, the guilds are more active in Inviroth than any other city, only they are mutually clandestine with their feuding.
As soon as he got his first glimpse John dropped it onto the ground, making a sound like a heavy object.
They're here to help find Mike.
the spaces were too open, the surroundings too quiet, and the trees too dour.
He righted the dresser, pulled out some clothes, and exchanged them for the sleeping clothes which he was wearing.
But, such a delay might put Mike into danger.
Yes.
it had looked unlocked since its partner was more flush with the window frame.
He was assaulted and nearly murdered by human thugs from the Brotherhood, just like the kind that he had recently taken revenge upon.
You just saw all around your head except for the very back.
But, one must ask, do you recognize them once they are outside of their usual context?
Neither Dan nor John could read so after searching around for a bit more, the two took the book to Chris' house where they hoped that Chris would be well enough to read it for them.
By the look of his garb, Roy believed that he really was a wizard!
Inviroth, with an army of seven thousand raced down upon the Ferazi, and Amroth's militia, seeing a distracted enemy, rushed out of the gates and pinned the Ferazi.
" You'll see," said Mike with a grin.
Well, I don't make enough at work, so I don't have enough money to pay for my journey.
When his index finger guided Caylan to about the center of the shelf, he muttered some sort of," Ah, here it is," to himself and pulled another smile again.
Thinking back to his childhood, John distinctly remembered having it one day and then hiding it because he didn't want it getting broken.
Roy caught the faint aroma of food.
He never thought that he'd come to this, taking advice from a story written and concocted by Derek Half wit, but it was the only way which John had heard of to get rid of a ghost.
The chanting echoed through Dan.
The dying man did not give out any audible sobs, but merely wrinkled his eyes, cheeks, and lips into a distorted grimace and allowed the tears flowed from his eyes.
This was by far the easiest part of my newly constructed foot path;
He himself thought the whole caper either silly if only chasing after fiction, or dangerous if true.
His house would inevitably be an apartment someplace near the market square so that he could get an early start on his job to feed his wife and several screaming kids.
I might' ve seen one like that but I'm not sure.
Over the next millennium both cities grew in population and grandeur, surpassing the beauty of the old world's cities.
But Roy couldn't do anything, because even if Roy had the bravery to grab for the rope and climb up to the surface, the Ferazi was between him and the rope.
Chapter twenty nine
There was too many statues ta remember.
It's now or never because everyday I get more and more stuck.
it grabbed me back here.
This concept is beyond understanding to a herbivore, that can go into any grassland and live.
The knight did not return with the dragon's head dragging behind his war horse nor did he set a beacon in the city to bring the citizenry running back to their repossessed home.
either zack had been extremely unlucky or the goon had tipped off his rabbit, which could explain why mike had not been seen.
The wizard was too busy to notice this.
Today was a very good day for him and he was enjoying it with relish, even taking some time to contemplate his situation and enjoy the moment.
But, since you don't believe me, I've brought in black paint.
Instead, John took the moment of respite to wonder why he was spending the night breaking into a mansion when he could be safely sleeping in his bed.
When they saw us coming they prodded their steeds and took off like the wind, our own mounts unable to keep pace because they were heavily loaded.
He peered at the small spot of light as he crept forward, sneaking as silently as possible.
In conclusion, I will not wait around, but demand to be entered.
John, sleepy and disgruntled, opened the door.
Family doesn't mean as much and they aren't as close.
By mid morning, the dogs tired of their chef and wandered away to leave me in unobtrusive solitude.
Or when it loses talons and acquires finger nails?
At the bottom of his kneel, with his enemy's sword stuck in Chris' shield and armor, Chris stabbed into the man's chest.
Roy wondered what intentions the wizard had for him.
At the next opportunity Dan pretended to look at some wares along the street but stole a few glances back, but the street behind him contained several people with black hair.
These strange creatures, as they were at the time, were starving, ragged, and spoke their own language, which they quickly dropped in favor of the vernacular, never using their original language again.
However, Chris' disappearance from the group, which Dan had attributed to that night in the warehouse, disturbed Roy.
Luckily, all of the windows looking onto the addition's roof were dark.
Todd lay on his bed, staring at his ceiling and watching the fire's dancing lights bounce around the room.
But how did the wizard learn about John and discover where he lived?
Blood was streaming out of the vertical wound, flowing down the man's stomach and down the right leg and into his shoe.
Having secured my future nourishment for a goodly time, I invested more time searching for a deed to be avenged.
That could be where the torture chamber was because Roy's current dwelling wasn't much of one.
Are good you?
Still, ya shouldn't go.
Several inquiries later, I deduced that he had asked me if I had ever been caving.
Although this is still a buzz word, typically considered meaningless, this noun does have substance and appears as an enormous building where each employee attaches small parts to a contraption.
The windows were all shuttered and the front door closed, just as Susan had described it.
" You see," Mike continued," the factory I work at is run by the Technos.
Roy stiffened and listened, but could hear was his heart beating and the faint crackling of a file.
A faint voice came from within the room," Go away.
But you just said that you were bored on a ship.
Maybe tomorrow he'd stop by and bring her some flowers or a chocolate.
Roy tried to think of another way to escape.
I see red, and then yellow, and then blue.
But, this still didn't answer why Ferazi lived underground.
Before Dan left, he gave Chris some of the money from the job.
After Lloyd's combat career came to an end when a Ferazi blade partially crippled Lloyd's left leg, he was forced to return to civilian life and he rode back to Inviroth, his future plans already mapped out, and his thoughts eagerly anticipating his future travels made possible by the three hundred thousand dollars he had acquired.
I whipped out the pad of paper that I happened to possess.
Hopefully he would lead them to the rest of the people in the group, and maybe even to the culpable Unification boss who had ordered the assault.
The rat's was so far below par, walking around, trying to shake stranger's hands, and being oblivious to the tension in the room, that John concluded that if he were the Remozsh, he'd be forced to kill himself out of disgust.
What did Ferazi society think of valor?
After going through the list of all his friends, acquaintances, and relatives, Dan could not think of anyone except Chris, and Chris' father.
Dan, at least ten years away from his childhood, found them nearly impossible to comprehend.
Mike nodded his head," Because they're all different.
I very slowly loosened my favorite dagger, and so as not to spread alarm, held it by the scabbard as I approached the half way mark.
But if you can't fulfill your obligations to yourself then why do you live?
Not happy with flinging smaller objects, the dresser began shaking and after a few convulsions it rose off of the ground, tottering back and forth.
When everything's okay we'll call you.
How much is a ship?
And who might the other guy be?
It was so big that I could sit in it.
And then the rain started with a whoosh and sudden downpour.
The wizard put the back cover down and flipped to the page marked by his right hand.
By the time that the blade's point disappeared underneath his skin, Todd was weak but he still managed to stand because of its support.
Caylan continued to thumb through the pages, stopping once every few leafs to let his fore finger peruse it for a few lines before the wizard forced his finger to relent and continue to flip the pages.
Ok man, but remember that I had no part in this.
The docks themselves are immensely interesting because of the proliferation of heroes, anecdotes, and legends to be which exercise their daily labor in the humble disguise of sailors, merchants, and traveling soldiers.
Just go knocking on all the doors.
John was dreaming!
So how are you gentlemen involved with this problem?
After all, Roy himself had even braved the ladder and returned back.
Dan looked around again just to make sure that no one was staring outside and noticed the shadow of a Remozsh as it slipped by Dan and into the room, probably Roy.
The man took a step back and parried, returned a low swipe towards Chris' legs, but is was blocked by Chris' shield.
but then mike was a traitor, and least in the eyes of zack, who consorted with the enemy.
Amroth, the youngest of the king's three sons, perceived the lamenting call of the western lands and persuaded his father to grant Amroth five thousand colonists to lead to the west.
Inviroth, being at the birth of the only road passing through the southern rift mountains, and being well favored by the Emperor, was the funnel through which all of the troops passed into the West, benefiting Inviroth immensely through the war's commerce and bravery.
Once the battles had subsided, Caylan would be left with the task of producing a reasonable excuse for the Emperor to remove the thieves.
Large quantities of fill had been used to block off corridors.
Have the police ignored your pleas?
A brunette bar maid dressed in a short red dress, probably to match the name of the tavern saw Dan and John and made here way to the table.
Maybe not all humans were the enemy.
After about thirty seconds, Roy got the hint and returned to the bed.
I'm a nice guy, right?
Some of the buildings even have a gentle lean, and one can imagine them swaying to and fro over a period of years, in sluggish imitation of their mobile neighbors.
Do you think he could turn me into an animal also?
The artworks had not changed since my last peep at them.
The light, although it appeared to be finite, was everywhere and all consuming.
In fact, they had only heard about the above ground through legends and had never really believed that it could exist, a" cavern without ceiling" as they called it.
Although it is little used today, the Empire having eliminated city state rivalries, the majesty and power of the castle still bear the mark of Arsellus' son and would buckle the knees of any invader.
Mike overheard you talking with someone.
If they have a different hair style, shaving style, clothes, shoes, or even sun glasses than my what my friends normally wear, I notice it right away.
He hoped that the wizard didn't suspect that he was being watched by the Remozsh but only considered Roy a nuisance.
Hi, could we speak to the manager?
Feeling alone and exposed, walking through empty streets with only a rat, Dan detoured from his planned path and walked to John's apartment a few doors down.
Everyone at Mike's work made small pieces of metal, cloth, wood, or other materials, and then put them together to form one large object, which as far as Mike could tell, didn't have any reason to be, because it didn't look like any of the familiar objects of the city and didn't do anything.
zack picked up the ears, reminisced about the hunts which he had gotten them from, some of them gotten from hunts with people who had left town or been killed by rabbits since then.
To comprehend the image which I have placed before you though, you must, unfortunately, put down my writings and make the pilgrimage to the greatest city in the western Empire.
" Yes sir ee" answered Ted confidently, confidently crossing his arms.
Well then, I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.
How do I get up?
Of course, his brothers had always used pillows, and only once or twice used a stick, but never a spear.
Even Chris admits it.
After a couple of days they did not even bother to sit and wait for Roy to fall onto their side, but wandered off to their usual beats, only occasionally diverting to verify Roy's presence.
They were just like the market, some clothes sellers, a few people selling food- mike bought be a sausage on a bun there.
Mike and Roy would walk around the city and" investigate", as Mike called it, romping around in search of something which they had never seen before, spending endless hours aimlessly strolling through the alleys and crooked streets in the act.
He had not noticed the subtle variations in humans and furthermore, had perceived all Humans to be identical in appearance and action, Mike excepted.
Of course, the West Empire Trading Company had some influence, but Weston was too inept and timid to do anything to counteract Caylan's move.
At what point does a claw become a finger, when it can grasp object?
My vision stops right over here.
Dan thanked her, and then took leave of Susan.
If Zack didn't move he would be next to be skinned.
Roy put forth another question.
He got it as far as his mouth before it started tightening again and John was forced to spend more effort loosening the bonds, but once he had done so he threw it off his head.
However, they happened upon several Remozsh skeletons, all of which must have been centuries old.
" Thanks," said Chris.
He fished two dollars out of his pocket and put them on the table.
All five digits are pointed in a dull black claw which curves like a cat's.
Luckily for those of us Humans on the earth, the stereotypical differences in thoughts, actions, and personality are just elements of our particular sub culture.
Unfortunately, even with all of the great libraries of Inviroth at my call, I was unable to discover any books on adventuring at the time.
I know all of 'em and I know what they order when they're at Lloyd's.
They hang out sometimes.
The gate was about five meters tall, made of wrought iron poles which were sharpened into spikes up at top, and locked with a very large padlock.
Every part of his body had thorns protruding from it.
" Hit me," he informed Curt, both the dealer and the only other player, who pulled a card off from the top of the deck, feigned a peek at it just to rile Zack up, and then slid it face down towards Zack.
All of the other times you have your fur.
It seemed to have worked for awhile but now the bastard was back and Zack might have to use more severe tactics, although Zack hadn't planned those out yet.
He tended to it dearly while he was alive, but when he left the world his prized possessions were thrown into the basement by my mother and forgotten by everyone except the rust.
The laws won't help you.
Roy crouched down and hid his head.
It was rumored that several of Lloyd's customers were high ranking members of the Thieves' guild, perpetrated by a day time burglary of the pub, while it was closed, and the subsequent return of the stolen goods and a compensation payment appearing a few days later.
Roy wondered if the Ferazi used their underground dwellings for magic, but did not think so.
I have a nice juicy leg here from a very fine beast.
All that he saw were the shells of knights, four to a wall, who were standing around the room's edges.
The medieval counterpart has likewise been torn, and I have added it to the pot, combining two worlds a thousand years different.
The herbivore didn't seem to notice though, nor did it really participate, but perpetually stare blankly at the wall, oblivious to the world in which it hopped.
Because he knew that it would spite his mother, Todd lazily turned his head prepared to stare his intruder down with deep set eyes and hellish grin.
Dan had managed to run forward a meter before Roy's head was submerged beneath the ground.
Remembering the dream would expose the source of the fear and allow Chris to logic the terror, which was only a figment of a dream, away.
But within, it acted as a stone colored bed sheet tucked in at the corners, sloping up towards the center where the torso stood and became the beast's skin.
Up until about two thousand years ago, there wasn't any Remozsh race, or at least one that was known by any of the other races.
Dan shrugged.
We can just walk you back home now.
Could he slay his savior?
Perhaps I am at a loss because the related story is true, and fate does not believe in morals.
He would make friends with whomever he wished.
I shall start my construction at the beginning of Inviroth's history.
John's dresser slid across the floor about a meter.
Jim was not killed by any weapon, but had his throat torn out but a clawed beast, and a pretty rabid one from the looks of the damage.
They even checked around the entire warehouse for entrances and exits but could not find any that had been used.
He had actually done fairly well, and discovered several residual tunnels but all of them were isolated from the rest of the city.
He could not jump down because he would inevitably break his leg or sprain an ankle, making running impossible.
All they do is devour the land, multiply into even greater numbers, and then devastate any field where they settle, eventually flying off in a swarm to yet another field.
Mike had given the same descriptions of a prison, although he denied that the city was a prison and insisted that he was free to do what he wanted.
A wheel obviously goes on a wagon, a link of metal into chain mail, and clay into a bowl.
It was ugly.
Ya don't need a bed.
Some people I know don't even have that.
An excellent tale can be gotten only for an ale or two, a far slimmer rate than that of a troubadour or adventurous tome, mine own excepting, of course.
He picked up his now empty stein and clinked it against John's.
The sticks would show where he entered.
Recalling my heroic manners, I proffered to give here an elegant kiss on her gloved fingers, but she withdrew them quickly, and in a melodic, almost flute like voice, entreated me:
Just yesterday he had sent the three out to catch a measly rat, actually two rats.
Within two days my trusty companion Fred, and I had acquired several mules, and a month's supply of food( mostly salted beef), water, and lantern oil.
John put on a dead pan face, something that would have alerted any of his friends that he was being sarcastic.
Maybe you should try coming back tomorrow.
We really screwed up.
He carried the mostly empty jar back to the podium, set the brush on top, and walked up to the edge Roy's cage.
Roy was brimming with excitement, since the wizard's entry, normally a fascinating event, was doubly so because Roy had just been bored out of his mind.
Your arms would make a good stew," knife waved by roy's shoulder," or perhaps your tail would be meatier.
After fainting, Roy awoke in a cage somewhat like those used to haul the circus animals into and about the city.
" Hey, watch it," cried out Ted's voice from nearby.
Ten or fifteen minutes later the wizard finally completed his circuit around the hall, left the sanctuary of the room's edges, and walked into the center of the room where he began to light some short pedestals scattered about in random positions.
The two did several other experiments with vision but didn't come up with any more startling revelations.
Sure are, Roy.
That eliminated Chris.
Even without Chris we can still finish it?
or so Zack hoped.
The Ferazi sheathed his sword, walked up to Dan, and began to examine his neck, turning and swiveling Dan's head for him in order to get a better view.
Zack's enemy took another high swing which Zack likewise blocked by raising the chair, but this time the Ferazi kicked underneath the chair and into Zack's stomach.
Well yes, but they won't do anything unless he's missing for a week, or there's an eye witness.
At that I broke in as quickly as I could before she vaporized.
The living structure upon which Roy rested was on the west side of an immense north south brick road.
It was a large building, about two stories high, and large enough to house a wealthy family, which was probably its origin.
Chris' mother walked down the hallway and though a door.
Could ya make that an order of barbequed chicken legs.
He pulled a bolt out of the bag, gripped it in his teeth, and proceeded to cock the crossbow.
Chris' mind eased knowing that reality was not cheating him.
Another more powerful disturbance occured and another ripple ensued, followed by a series of other even more powerful waves which rocked Roy at each passing.
A bloody battle ensued, but by the end of the next day the field was littered with eight thousand of the enemy.
Also, two hundred years ago, people were effectively" racist" about religion, and protestants and catholics never mixed.
perhaps zack would just follow his previous train of thought, it being completely logical and.
Even though you may be lacking any heroic anecdote, worry not, for there is plenty to spare and men are free with their words.
Dan chose a corner table for the meeting, not because he particularly cared, but because all clandestine meetings were supposed to happen in poorly lit corner tables, or at least that's what Chris' books had said.
They would all be hunted down and killed, all because Roy thought that he was a hero and chased this villain underground.
"Yeah, ya trying ta get us all killed" added Russ.
Look at what we've got, a geeky guy who hangs around with rabbits and rats.
Roy didn't let the man get behind him since he quickly turned around and ran away as fast as he could, hearing the man's diabolical laughter.
He fell forward, his upper body landing outside the magical walls, but his foot was snagged, and the seething ground pulled him in. Roy only had a couple of seconds to scream," Help!
Ted was standing out in the mouth of the alley.
The goons were clearly incompetent, but that's what you get with a one week search for a group of thugs that have not belonged to the Thieves' guild.
Ultimately only the pub is left as a communal gathering, and I sorrow for the metropolis without such a building.
Hmm.
Chris knew that he'd have to at some point but didn't think admitting it to the Remozsh would do anything but produce more questions.
Roy's collar tore off into the beast's claw, freeing the Remozsh of his noose, and allowed him to bolt up the ladder, his fiendish opponent thwarted.
I can even recognize much more complex patterns, such the letters of the alphabet and mathematical symbols.
Roy laid on his belly with his feet towards the pit, and slowly pushed his feet over the precipice, all the time expecting cold hands to clench his ankles and yank them, along with the rest of Roy's body, down into the darkness.
How many Ferazi could there possible be with only one ear?
Deciding upon an assault led to another question.
I have only ever seen one once while I was exploring a remote castle, and the man was quick to take leave of me.
I was about to ask of her for a less exhausting entrance to her manor than I had previously used, when I noticed that she had vanished.
Although he wanted the air dearly, Todd couldn't stop the itch and coughed.
Yeah you are buddy boy.
of course, it was pitch black and curt hadn't even bothered to leave his apartment's door open.
The hounds had discovered the intruders and started barking as they ran to catch up with them.
Sometimes even, the market is a scene for a macabre entertainment where one watches a here to fore neighbor be stabbed in the back, or perhaps even hanged from a tree.
To them, most of nature is a waste land and only that which you work for, either by finding, growing, or killing, is of any value.
Acting upon this plan, Zack slowly lifted the chair off of his chest and quietly placed it on the floor next to him, all the while listening for changes in the Ferazi's actions.
By the time the good reader gets to this point he will only be one third through this book, and I assure you that the rest of the book is even more amazing.
about this time zack regained enough composure to look around the room and see what everyone else was doing.
Roy smiled.
He closed the door and descended the stairs, reaching the bottom just as the Ferazi mounted its horse.
Roy was torn from the ladder by his shirt collar, screamed as loud as he could, and then fainted.
Chris head a bow string snap, a brief whizzing, and then an impact on the left hand side of the chamber.
She was always so nice and gracious.
John stopped before he had gotten any more disgusting, already have had enough to satisfy his curiosity.
Curt complied, got back in his chair, and tossed Zack another card.
From these rose a fairly straight trunk for about one meter, clothed in convoluted bark.
That was a month ago.
Relying upon past experience, Todd knew that if he got up now he'd be hit right away.
C'mon guys, we've gotta get outta here.
The rat didn't even have enough sense to clean itself, something which even the high and mighty cats could handle, although John didn't consider licking oneself too sanitary.
Much of the bliss was destroyed when the unethical Ferazi mustered an army eight thousand strong and assaulted the walled city of Amroth.
It'll just be a minute.
Hmm, odd.
yelled Caylan in a much smaller voice than his chanting lead Dan to expect.
This happened with the protestants and Catholics, and the European immigrants that came to America.
I think that the information about the factory is enough for now," answered Dan.
We had a gentleman's agreement, and although I can not take it to a court of law, I demand upon your honor that you pay me according to the agreement.
Emperors and kings try to mold the world with their own hands.
Zag had watched Scott's post closing activities from outside several times.
Roy felt like he was a flag in a steady gale, pulling the tether rope taunt, holding on for dear life, and only prevented from flight by his attachment to the strained rope.
But how would that solve the problem of Roy's captivity?
Suddenly, though, over the span of about a year, thousands of Remozsh wandered out from the wilderness and mountains, in all very different regions of the occupied lands.
Sadly, if I had been alive only fifteen years prior, I would have enough hire to make me a wealthy man, although judging upon previous methods of payment, I suspect that the locals would have paid me with Troll meat, something I do not desire.
While he wrestled with the white sheets, sticking to him as if a fierce wind were pushing them into him, Dan was forced to conclude that he was having a nightmare.
A hand!
According to that, fifty% of minorities are criminals.
" Naw, just heard someone in there," and Roy pointed to the window," but Mike told me not to go in, so I didn't.
A woman couldn't do anything in combat, especially being without armor and inexperienced.
He had works from all of the great writers, including some original manuscripts from Henry the White, Mason, and John Carmen.
Todd rolled onto his stomach, near one end of the bed, and heaved his back up, toppling the bed and the Ferazi away from him.
All were in near perfect unison.
unfortunately roy lost track of them when a large dog chased him down the the street and around the block.
Roy abandoned the wall and followed suit, knocking over another garbage can, rolling it to face Ted's, and sat inside.
Dan could pass over the reason by merely saying that Roy was a Remozsh and prone to doing strange things.
Don't worry, he won't get' cha.
Dan might be able to get away claiming that he witnessed the event though.
John took around to see if anything else exciting had happened in the room, but Dan waas still staring into the middle of the room, and the rat had managed to bounce to the other end of the room.
John countered," Yeah but if it weren't for him we'd never have done it.
Chris wondered if he was supposed to remove the sword, and decided that he should, reached out with both hands.
He followed Mike's queue, and just like the vision question, asked about the differences and combinations of notes.
However, he heard the Ferazi take a few footsteps toward Curt, saw a sword emerge from behind the table and pierce Curt through the chest.
This is to be expected since pattern recognition is a large part of" intelligence.
Dan was still struggling under his assailant, although John didn't see any blood yet.
I considered it impressive that the Ferazi wore chainmail on their bare skin until later one of the members of my group pointed out that they had fur to temper the coldness.
And then Dan saw movement on the stairway.
Well, I suppose that I go to work, quit at night, and then go to sleep wherever I can find someplace warm.
Of those people, most are white, and the rest cover minority groups in America.
Having nothing else to do, Roy examined the bowl outside the cage.
Well, maybe not, thought Roy.
So what da we do?
But Roy never got completely used to the cage though because the silence was incredibly boring and almost nerve racking.
After that I'll go and find out where Zack lives.
Caylan's finger stopped and the wizard actually turned to glare at Roy.
Realizing that in such a location he wouldn't be able to attract enough customers to remain in business, the locals too few and all of the ocean originating clientele would disappear into the pubs along the coast, several miles from his building, Lloyd was forced to forge a new method of attracting customers.
I require your services to watch my husband.
Obviously, Julie was still upset with him, and Paul was likewise upset with himself for doing what he'd done.
" I don' know," said the rat, and then it paused to think, its finger resting on its lips, as though that somehow turned on its mental faculties.
He's the guy you had a scuffle with in Lloyd's.
Roy saw the branches turned into bony arms and hands with long thorny fingernails.
Yeh, it looks like it.
Underneath his arm he carried a rather large box, almost too large even to be carried single handily.
Roy took a quick glance at the pit just to make sure that nothing was climbing out yet, but all that he could see was a rising cloud.
The blade was of stupendous quality, extracted from the ore in one of the more famous mines in the Ranson Mountains, and the hilt was carved oak.
Nothing except bitch and moan about how bad things are, and have kids so that they can continue the moaning.
That started this whole mess in the first place, and he was not about to blow his advantage by using some overkill sorcery.
Better outcomes included being hired by one of the guilds, or discovering some secret worth a lot of money to one of the competing guilds.
They let Mike in but when I tried to come in the guards stopped me, but the mike told the guards that I was with him and they let me in."
Can you point out the black line which I just painted?
What he saw and heard proved his suspicion.
Yeah, they don't hurt that much if you go slowly.
Know I.
Both seemed to contain a dark brown liquid.
I would suspect that the attentive reader is beginning to fret at the moment since, as I said earlier, Lloyd ultimately purchased a pub, while at the current junction in my tale he's about to become a merchant.
So the question lay before Dan, should he put down the novel in hand and grab a new one, even at the risk that his new fiction would be even more droll than the previous or that it be only a short story?
He just goes to lloyd's to eat, and goes home afterwards where he reads, and when he gets some time off he likes exploring just like us.
I didn't know who I should follow but decided that Henry was more important, so I followed him but I lost him.
But, thought John, it undoubtedly considered its missing ear as much of a status symbol as the good ole boys enjoyed showing the same ear around to their friends.
Although the wars and natural disasters are very important to a historian, for the most part they did not effect Inviroth and hence belong in another chapter;
As john climbed the final step to Mike's apartment, just before he got a glimpse inside the window, hoped that the rabbit had gone back on its word and had failed to come.
From the sky Inviroth would look like a semi circle with its straight edge against the azure sea to the East.
He must have thought you were good enough to look into, so when I saw that Mike was missing, and the police refused to start investigating for three days, I decided to see you.
After some minutes of indiscriminate cage rattling, Roy figured out that the front opened up but it was locked with a padlock on the left hand side.
Curt likewise rummaged through his purse and pulled out ten dollars, leaving him only two dollars.
The door was slightly ajar, and must have been open all night.
No problem;
The wizard could claim check mate then because the Thieves' Guild would be warring with the Organization in no time, allowing Caylan to relax, sit back in his armchair, and watch the battles discredit both of the guilds.
Who should I ask?
Mike pointed past the terrified Ferazi and spoke," The wizard sent it after you.
Why then had Roy's mother taught him the contrary?
Something creaked half way to Roy's destination and he halted motionless and quiet, except for his throbbing heart which was pounding loudly enough to wake up anyone within the neighborhood.
He lit a candle, lead me out of the room, through a hallway, down a beautiful set of marble stairs, and into a large hall, where he held up his candle to two exquisite paintings above the fireplace.
It took a step forward, taking aim at Dan.
The Remozsh stood motionless, and attempted to identify and locate the sound.
But, being so forced, he attempted to methodically consider the alternatives.
Neither of them said a word, but they grabbed hold of the horse's reins and headed back to Dan's apartment.
Dan tried to be paranoid.
Excuse me sir, but why?
Beyond the hill's ridge, Roy could see the southern edge of Inviroth in the hazy distance.
zack even thought that it might of come from the same path which he had run from but wasn't sure.
At sunrise the next day, I approached the leafy wall and climbed the thorns, all the time noting that if my armor had not run away, my skin would have been saved many thorny punctures.
Someone knocked on the door, probably Susan, so Dan slid off of his dresser and opened the door for Susan.
Zack got up and walked over to the door, opened it, looked down the stairs.
Even it's face was soiled, adding to the eyes to make a rather dumb look, saying," Hi I'm Roy.
" If we need to fight to rescue Mike, will you help us?
but maybe.
" Oh," he said in the quiet voice of someone delivering bad news," No one ever told me his name.
" Stop looking at the body," said Dan in a gentle voice.
Until then even the grandest cathedral of words is naught but a collection of sentences, but once the real cathedral is experienced in life, the cathedral of words transforms from a series of sentences into a hand held duplicate of the real structure.
The bag fell down and the black haired thug pulled out a crossbow.
Maybe Mike was good friends with Roy also, and the Roy felt compelled enough it risk its life to discover who had murdered him.
Letting himself slide down even more, Roy sent his left foot down lower to look for the next rung and found it half a meter below the first.
Deciding that he'd make a really big mistake to come to the ghetto, Chris picked up his walk to almost a jog.
When his head turned in the direction of the demon, his jaw dropped and eyes opened wide for a moment, and then began to frantically yell and thrash.
Since half of the whites on TV are criminals, half of that remaining ten% must be criminal.
It pushed back a bit but then wedged up against a chair and didn't move any further.
Chris slowed to a walk and scanned the room from left to right, his gaze passing over a few odd crates, barrels, and piles of clothes without seeing any hiding thugs.
Come in now and I'll take ye two her.
Surprisingly, the Ferazi rode bear back with no saddle, blankets, or stirrups.
After its attempts to wriggle out of the knots failed, the Remozsh started to scream hysterically and foam at the mouth.
The eye adjusts and adapts to the colors it is surrounded with.
Failing to find any solace in the previous alley, Chris blindly took a turn and ran into a sweating fat man with dark curly hair, and a little mustache, holding a leg of lamb in his hand.
The actual leg part was short, but the hare's feet were twice as long as any humans, and they were very flat, seemingly without a heel.
" Let's try getting through the second story window," whispered Dan just before he snuck off towards the house.
By the way Roy, are ya gonna stay up there all day.
The trunk, the branches, the bark, the leaves, and the knot holes all had a personality which appeared to be guided by some chaotic genius.
From off in the distance he got a reply," Thanks for stopping by.
The Unification was certainly not so stupid as to tell a Remozsh anything strategic.
He then stared forward towards the center of the room and began speaking in a loud and commanding voice.
Or what of the robed man had some sort of weapon?
They were all hired mercenaries and had no personal involvement.
The wind stirred up the chattering leaves for a moment and the birds quieted down.
Roy stood resolutely in place defending his right to speech.
The floor, walls, and ceiling were one piece of solid rock, without any stone and mortar being used anywhere.
Henry finished sipping the glass of wine on the table and put down some money for the bill.
Another Ferazi, the one wearing the black tunic, accepted the package from the scout, opened it slightly, sniffed inside, and as if in disgust, or perhaps in anger, cast it to the ground without having the decency to taste any of it.
He was tall, very erect, and unlike the servant, walked quickly, almost with a mechanical stride.
You won't last too long here either.
A horse cantered down the street, closer and closer to Roy's hideout alley, the hooves clipping on the cobblestones of the street and upsetting the night time silence which had pervaded.
Show you I." With one free hand the Ferazi motioned for Roy to climb down the rope after him.
With great reluctance, for Arsellus deeply loved his son, Amroth was permitted to sail with five thousand men and women in nearly one hundred ships.
Furthermore, the walls and ceiling formed one continuous dome of roughly hewn texture except for a few reliefs.
Something to do with the factory that Mike works at.
Dan took a sip of his ale.
Chris walked up to it, but before he could get within talking distance, it picked up its char and went inside, closing the door after itself.
The first thing that comes to my mind when I see someone wearing a base ball hat backwards is," That's stupid.
I'm not really sure but I got an idea.
When I see text in front of me, I automatically and sub consciously read it.
Instead, the human, of all things, put a handful of carrots by the bedside, next to the mug that was already there.
He could have stopped anytime but he continued the game.
First of all, he was too short for racks designed for humans.
Ted lifted the armor up part way.
We'll figure out a way to get Roy.
Dan followed John down the stairs and outside, where they stared at each other and what to do about Chris.
" You are clueless then," said Ted, and he got into one of his preaching modes.
the room was very musty and smelled like rotting wood.
Upon first entering the caves they glittered and sparkled with pointy teeth, both above and below, water dripping from one canine to its partner below.
I only hope, ironically, that my writing abilities will fail to accurately portray the beasts before me.
It was probably his bitch of a mother, coming out from her room to rag on him some more about some sort of useless chore that he hadn't finished today.
From these rose a fairly straight trunk for about one meter, clothed in convoluted bark, after which the straight path became obscured to the onlooker and the designed took a drunken course, even going to far as to split the gigantic pillar into two contrary branches.
As a small child I had taken an interest in these articles and had spent many hours playing with them, assuming the roles of a great general or knight.
It did not translate so nobly though, but Mike understood.
How could anyone be so pathetic?
Kinda like that.
Roy, naturally, was appalled by this suicidal move, and didn't wish to climb any further away from the surface than he had do.
After resting a minute, the wizard picked up the jars by kneeling down to grab a hold of them, and carried them past Roy and to the podium where he placed the jars down again.
The whole attic was one large room interrupted by rafters and support beams, with boxes and old furniture scattered around the edges.
Are ya there?
Of course, there always was the occasional murder in the city, but it was unlikely that anyone would murder John just for fun, while he knew full well that the poltergeist was out to kill him.
If you want, we can move to another city or try joining the army.
All of the while I spent walking to the front door, I also spent scanning for the hell hounds, but luckily they didn't recognize me, my disguise was so complete.
Dan found himself staring directly at John's face, with John's hands clasped around Dan's head, and his lips mutely talking.
so, after work the next day, i went over and started ta watch' t.
We also have to talk with Zack and.
Soldiers used to yell out the word to pull the Ferazi out of hiding.
The quest to help someone had become a quest for revenge of Mike's death.
Perhaps Chris' enemy would have been his friend during any other time or in any other circumstance.
Some of them were quite intelligent, not nearly as stupid, obnoxious, or lazy as the reputation which had preceded them.
So close to death was he on that August night that the humans did not even consider it worth the effort to kill him;
Oh, are you so sure?
I didn't think humans realized that.
When he noticed this, Roy stood up and prepared to climb down since it was too far to jump, but he did not have time;
Then, to John's total bewilderment, his pewter plate levitated off of his dresser and then accelerated towards him.
Perhaps none of them had ever been greeted so courteously before, or perhaps they didn't understand my words.
By and by we made our way down, and about half an hour in, perhaps four or five caverns, we found the mark which farmer John had left when he was a child, still sharp as ever, next to a crevice which we squeezed through.
Her mother smiled," Why yes she is.
The fire dimmed as he put the log on, but after he prodded the new log into place the tiny flames returned in order to climb up the new log, devouring as they went.
John began climbing the gate, going as fast as he could, but given the pace of the fight, at an excruciatingly slow pace.
It was far beyond Roy to comprehend how anyone could live so close to such nefarious monsters.
Yes he is, but he's still sick.
I am he, and he humbly places one of his future deeds at your service.
" Here's to that," answered Bob enthusiastically.
" Well, since you're so jealous, I'll let you have him.
The body continually spouted sub geysers away from the main body and in all directions, even downward.
Before Roy could put in a word against John, Dan explained," Chris didn't like the fight we had underground.
Pete might even be carrying a bucket of water or something to splash at Paul.
Both of them turned to look back at Roy with smiling faces.
Chris turned around to see where Roy had gone but then was forced to return his attention to the hole when he heard some voices down below.
While I drew on a conversation with the stoic farmer, gaining no support from the silent man, he was remembering something which he had seen while still quite young.
Caylan backed up slowly, still watching where he walked, and maneuvered his way around the pentagram.
Happy that his father had never noticed the board and nailed it in, John eagerly looked in the darkness of the sub floor for" it" but could see nothing.
Forty thousand dollars was a lot of money and could get Dan and John anywhere in the empire.
In addition, the conflict arises from history, since the Humans and Ferazi have been having wars for generations;
The foe took a step and made a top down swing at Chris' left shoulder, unprotected by the shield.
So, a hypothetical question arose in John's mind.
We lost the Ferazi over the horizon forty five minutes later, never to see them again during our trip.
It sure looks like it.
Howdy.
He looked over the set, considered the alternatives for a moment, and then moved a X up to the top.
if curt, for whatever reason, was disabled, one of the others would have to load the crossbow with their bolt and take over curt's job.
The swaying limb upon which he balanced was at least five meters off the ground, much higher than it had been in the daylight.
after sniffing a few more times roy decided that some of the smoke odor was recent, and carried with the aroma of something more interesting.
He was very close, only a short sprint to the ladder which would lead him up to safety, when Roy heard something close upon him, but he wasn't certain with all the noise his heart, feet, lungs were creating.
She continued to flip through the pages for a while and then turned to a blank page near the middle, where she flipped backwards until she came to the last entry.
But even more than that debt, Mike became a friend and displayed that at least one human in the city was worth saving.
You can borrow a few dollars from your friends, but you can't get the money that I need.
The wizard wished that he had better men working for him, and just over a week ago he had some of the best for the work he required, reasonably intelligent, but not enough to cause him problems, and skilled in some of the clandestine arts which he needed without having ever been members of the Thieves' Guild.
All of the Remozsh fled from the underground, and near the site of their historical appearances were all caves, many of which I investigated and followed to the huge caverns and mazes beneath.
By leaving the security of his apartment he was casting his die, hoping that he'd win, but perhaps ending up more miserable than he began.
Roy had never heard of such places before, and could never remember the endless list of names afterwards, but Mike knew about all of them.
Volume one. The Underground.
he dropped the candle and ran as fast as he could away from the small warren, taking any street and any diversionary turn that he could find, occasionally stopping to check that curt, pete, russ, and todd were behind him, and to make sure that there weren't any charging ferazi.
John's senses abandoned the erudite speculation and focused on reality.
Look chris, even if we do put up signs, what are we gonna write?
The first question which entered into John's mind was, what was she doing here?
Geysers were nothing more that a spout of viscous mud and water spewing from the ground.
The only problem with the plan was that Roy didn't have a knife, and chewing through the rope would take a long time, maybe too long.
in order to rid the streets of an extraordinarily dangerous ferazi, and because he feared himself marked for dead by the beast, zack was determined to hunt it down as quickly as possible.
And why did Roy lose that chance and spend his remaining years in shame, he asked himself.
And, just like a plague, they proceeded to ravage and destroy the land, crawling over one another in their frenzy to feast on the most succulent shoots, reproducing in gluttonous ecstasy, and constructing overcrowded hives to hold their progeny.
Discovering my wits, and my tongue along with them, I ran after the lady in order to accept the job and provide her with a farewell indicative of my gratitude, but could find no carriage nor soul outside the doorway.
Unfortunately, this last idea was pointless because Dan didn't have any weapon except a knife, while the thug was likely to have something longer.
His eyebrow raised to emphasize the point.
I survive perfectly well without any carrion.
This is the way that one must address all respectable ladies, which surely she was.
Roy definitely had to sneak in. Maybe he'd even try it tonight.
There's only humans to drink, and Remozsh to do the waiting.
The creature, probably a cat from it's size, moved closer to Dan's legs because he could feel the sheets ripple and pull around his feet.
Back many years ago, long before my time, in the nine hundred seven of the Empire( if I am not mistaken), Lloyd's pub was officially founded on Gray street, in the city of Inviroth.
Although my fingers were sad to part, I left the blade as a peace gift so that my knowledge, and the noble reader's, might be expanded by a conversation with the Ferazi.
Todd took another breath but felt like he was breathing in water and coughed again.
If they walked by any unique shop, Mike and Roy would enter for a look about, and any shop keeper which protested Roy's presence would be rebuked by Mike and given a lecture in the Remozsh's defense.
On the other side of the road was the wizard's mansion, having its complimentary thorn hedge, dogs, garden, and mansion just like the others on the street.
The next day Roy would have to explain to Dan how he had lost Mike's murderer and Dan would call Roy stupid because once the villain had discovered that his plans were thwarted he would never return to the underground hide out.
Around midnight, while in a slumber, I plummeted from the tree.
Dan considered running, but he was armored, tired, and pulling a loaded horse behind him.
However, Dan did find a set of folding stairs near the center of the attic which led downstairs.
Even if I thought this were a good idea, we're stuck, except for some paranoid factory manager who makes buggy whips.
Perhaps I had posted a sign close to the graveyard, or maybe one of my pamphlets had been likewise buried in the ground and it's soul, although I wonder if a paper has a soul, communicated with hers?
There was nothing there but another long passage opening into a large cavern, but only a small part of it was visible from the end of the passage.
Two horizontal streams flowed out of the" geyser" from somewhere near the top, and formed arms almost like a person's, but from liquefied mud.
Roy shouted proudly, and then realized that he shouldn't have said that.
They were all charlatans vying for power with whatever cunning they could muster.
he jumped out of bed, opened his disk drawer, and pulled out a piece of paper, pen, and ink well.
Once I scaled the bush, I climbed onto the wall and surveyed the estate.
Did that make John one of them?
A few moments later the two thugs reached the base of the tree and looked up at Roy, who until then could only see that one had jet black hair and the other a sandy brown.
I concluded that she was so rushed for fear of detection by her husband, and so I resolved to forgive my transgressions.
How about Mike's place?
I had plenty of time to explore these marvels since travel with the mules was slower, so we didn't reach the crevice for nearly an hour, and then we were forced to coax the cautious mules through.
She would spend months worrying, even years, wondering what her son was up to, if he was still alive, if he was hurt, or if he was well.
The enemy's clothes were soiled and shredded country clothes.
It might of been because of the age of John's house, but he suspected that it was because of the homelessness of the apartments Or maybe he had just forgotten how to find a good hiding spot.
While the Ferazi was mourning the loss of his last ear, John noticed that another thing had also been cut lose when the blade swung.
Although, coming from the human's market, all of the different food groups tasted equally as bland and could all be classified under the a single term, lifeless.
I have expounded upon the virtues of this very house frequently in my travel logs, and while the food is often lacking, one will feast upon the tales within, for no other pub has such noteworthy clientele.
Forgetting all other dangers, the Ferazi opened up his pouch and gently placed his severed ear in it.
John got a closer look at it and noticed that it looked just like a Ferazi ear.
Zack peeked under the card and smiled just to play with Chris.
John finally mustered a counter argument.
However, Roy went back a second time and counted only five different colors of bindings, give or take a few close shades.
Zack motioned with his hands.
What were you and Roy doing when the men approached you?
But you said that you wanted to travel around the wilderness and live off your wits.
It illuminated a cat sized bulge which sat in the middle of the bed and which moved slightly when the light turned on.
With his chair leaned up against the south west corner of the bar, the setting sun light of springtime streaming in to the windows in his left, Zack surveyed his domain.
Susan would be luckey if she weren't killed or wounded, going into battle without any kind of armor or weapon.
Paul wished that he could be with his girlfriend too, but Paul and Julie had gotten into a little fight just a few nights before, and as was the way with fights, the two needed a cooling off time before they spend any length of time together.
His back likewise was sore, but Zack forced himself not to scream or grasp for every stab of pain.
Roy commonly saw horses during the day, but Roy's nocturnal experiences on the open street told him that the horses weren't ridden at night, and now this unusual sound awoke him out of his trance.
The poltergeist could have been an illusion and all of the damage was ultimately done by John himself in a magic induced delusion.
and they live underground!
The remozsh almost ran inside and made for Dan's bed, while Susan walked calmly and sat herself on Dan's chair.
Ah, go then I.
I inform you such to aid you in your journeys, especially those in Inviroth, for to truly understand a man, or a neighborhood, or a city, you must talk to him, not in a business context, but as fellow man.
Not knowing what to do with the rope, John tried to pass if off to Dan but his friend ignored him, so he was forced to hold onto the rope, even though he was tempted to leave it lying somewhere.
Many theorists surmised that some god had spontaneously generated the race, although none could determine a use for them, nor have any since.
The point where he had set his torch fire now alight;
She gestured down towards a brown Remozsh which Dan just noticed.
The floor was cool, but warmer than the ground outside, and had a layer of dry dirt over it.
hopefully, most of the holes were well centered around the bulls eye.
Sure, I haven't been in a tree like this before.
Some would return years later, much wizened, and would inspire more youths to break their chains.
The robed figure must have gone underground, but what could take it so long?
He knew that Curt must be getting the crossbow now, but then a terrible thought hit Zack.
Do ya think they'll ever kick us out?
Dan wondered why the guy was so paranoid, and if it was just a quirk of the man, or if he had reason to be, and then Dan wondered if he should assume the same kind of paranoia just to be safe.
Extending from the castle gates is Garden Street, a lane of opulent mansions and lush foliage.
Roy had expected a hundred or so of them just like there had been on the walls and was disappointed by the small numbers.
Cold, dew covered branches would scratch him as they waved in the fictitious wind, maybe even trying to grab the writhing Remozsh.
Instead of monsters and wizards, Roy pondered Chris, who seemed like a nice guy just like Mike, although much quieter and more reserved;
One of the thugs picked up speed and chased the Remozsh around a corner beyond Roy's sight.
Maybe he was being barraged with supernatural assaults and thought that he was going crazy too.
But why not borrow money from any cousins or aunts?
But perhaps I am jumping ahead too far, because when Inviroth first arrived at the destined city's site it was occupied by a tribe of Ferazi who had excavated immense warrens in the cliff's stone, and he was forced to wage war upon them.
Whenever a racist has started talking to me about his views, he never hates minorities because they have dark skin, but because their accents sound stupid, or he think's they're all lazy or all criminals.
Inviroth is a metropolis of two levels.
I said that Ted saw him.
As is common conduct during war, or when approaching a potentially hostile enemy, we erected a white flag to demonstrate our good intentions and to clearly state that we were not looking for battle.
Mike's thirst for intrigue and excitement overtook him, and he decided to become a vigilante and prevent the burglary himself, wining the respect of his manager, and maybe opening a door to a better future.
He continued to ignore it, hoping that it would stop.
Surprisingly, the lady had a cogent explanation.
I don't even have a chance to intellectually challenge it because half of the minorities that I've ever seen have been criminals, and TV has proven it to me.
But when Roy walked into the alley Ted dashed all of Roy's hopes.
More lightning and Roy spotted the hedge only a few meters below him, the closest place to jump to, and his only chance.
By and by we made our way down, and about half an hour in, perhaps four or five caverns, we found the mark which farmer John had left when he was a child, still sharp as ever, next to a crevice which we squeezed through, our jacket buttons barely squeezing through.
He wished that he were sitting beneath a maple because its leaves were much sweeter and were almost as good as clover.
John called it breaking and entering with intent to injure, and a very stupid idea if one wanted to live a free man, albeit in a good cause.
That's not gonna work.
When it reached Chris small finger, the lowest point in the chain, the blood congregated and dripped off onto the ground.
He'd discover people and places never yet seen, learn of the greater mysteries of the world, and to right injustices.
The farmer gave me a jacket to wear, saying that the caverns were cold, and we hiked two miles up to the cave sight, near the top of a wooded hill.
Of course, being an honest gentleman, I must admit that my youthful foes did not have the armor of my uncle, and would suffer terribly from any blows that I landed with one of my uncle's swords.
There's no way a ferazi army 'd get that far.
This is not as far fetched, because the guild espouses mechanical devices to be the panacea of the Empire, rather than the magic of the Wizard's guild.
Uh, Miss Andersen.
Even if I did have enough money now, I'd eventually run out and then I'd be stuck.
Being half asleep during his conversation with Dan, he hardly remembered any of it, except that he volunteered to rescue the rat tomorrow night.
Frankly, I was shocked at this reaction since beasts are always eager to eat food, especially quality human food.
Now when John had chipped in his money with Chris and Dan to buy the equipment, he had never actually considered that it might be used in a real situation.
Both times Roy and Ted ventured enough bravery to enter the warehouse a few minutes after the man had disappeared through the door, but they never found him or any trace of where he had gone.
The mighty wizard did not even have enough time to call out for help before his head was dragged into the demonic pool.
Without saying anything, Caylan rushed to Roy's cage, and manipulated a padlock.
the bleeding groove had some dried blood in it from his last foray- zack would have to clean it better this time.
" Oh, this is Chris," said Susan, pointed to each person as she named them," Dan, John.
After creeping left down a more deserted street and then another quick left, Dan leaned against the wall and waited for his pursuant to come by, but no one did.
Once over the razor blades, Dan climbed down a bit and then jumped the rest of the way.
If Mike hadn't told Roy about this, then where had Roy found out about it?
About half way through, Chris saw another enemy, hovering near the wall with a sword in hand.
John had a handful of broken objects in the garbage, but these could have easily been thrown around by himself in a hysterical fit which was blacked out of his memory.
Roy slowly scanned around the room, expecting a dark figure to rush towards him at any moment, but didn't see or hear anything.
Should the prankster ever return, I would tell her off, regardless of her charm.
Let me go pull at the lock some more.
He'll be here.
She opened it, flipped to the beginning, scanned over a few pages, and then answered," Yes, it's Mike's.
But, you've got to go outside while I paint so that I know that you can't peak.
Just to phase the expectantly watching Curt, Zack interjected a confident," Yes!
He had not bothered to interrogate the Remozsh because it would not know anything useful;
It's the advertisement that I wrote.
The book must have been very heavy because it dived towards the ground when Caylan had extracted it from the shelf, but was saved with the wizard's effort.
It was a fear which Dan could not ally by claiming that he was an adult now and that childhood monsters had ceased to exist.
Maybe every demon beast trying to leap out of the body was pulled back in by three others who desired their own chance at the outside world.
Roy didn't know what else to do so he gave her a hug and unleashed a flood of memories, mostly about how he had left her eight years ago and had never seen her since.
He then took another right at an alley, and then a left at another street, much smaller than garden street.
The silhouette stopped about a meter from the cage, bent down and deposited a bowl.
Caylan seated himself in front of his desk, pulling up his high back armchair of cranberry leather, and surveyed his success.
The hunchback would easily get all of the information he needed before he could even finish strapping Roy onto the rack, so Roy would eventually be let go without so much as an hair's width of extra height.
No one help him.
Dan stood outside pondering what explanation he would give and wondering if he was granted audience too quickly, considering the elitist personalities involved.
Roy took another quick panorama over the horizon just to prove the point.
It might have been a trained cat, or maybe even a Ferazi, which would mean that the Unification was working with the Aliari.
The two walked far afield of Inviroth, sometimes even spending one day walking away from the city and the next returning.
Looking from atop the tree, Roy's home was an insignificant strip of brown buildings with pitch roofs bordered by a ribbon thin wall and mostly obscured by the hill's silhouette.
It was odd, but he had never discovered any hiding places equally as good in the apartments he had stayed in since leaving.
And ya just go to sleep where ever ya can.
Dan gave a confused look and the manager gave a sigh and pointed to the west.
This was not the time to have a flashback.
However, some of the stranger's stories were so complex that Roy would have been totally lost if Mike had not reiterated them to Roy when they were alone and explained all of the fine points.
Oh that, that's Fred.
By the time Dan got inside, Roy was already scampering around the room and Chris was searching through papers and books which were scattered around the room.
Zack opened his closet door and pushed aside his assorted collection of shirts and pants, all virtually identical to one another in color and general design, and stepped into the small room as far as he could go.
The natives can live off the bounty of their underground world without any supplies from above.
While a Ferazi chef survived with just one knife, a human cook had dozens of different specialized knives with arcane shapes.
Old men swear that the guild has the majority of city officials under its hand.
While Humans were numerous, they tended to pack themselves tightly onto the small portions of land upon which their cities and towns rested, and only a very few lived outside of Human" civilization", even if it only was two hour's travel from the sprawling hub.
This sounded serious, enough even to wake Dan up some more.
What is incredible about such manufacture is the worker's requisite skill, about nil.
John looked around for someone that was sitting along and from whom he could at least get one free drink, hoping that if the management saw John sitting around with a drink in his hand they wouldn't kick him out.
Roy decided that had to get out of the cage because while he stood locked inside, he was vulnerable to tentacles!
Every person has his own little cell, called a bedroom or apartment, with locked windows and doors to supposedly keep the criminals out.
Ya see.
From the road however, not a single garden was visible, protected from prying eyes by the walls of vegetation and savage guard dogs.
A Ferazi doe wouldn't have any babies if the warren were too crowded.
Touching his ear produced almost the same feeling as when his tooth was knocked out and he touched the virgin gum, except that his gums quickly hardened and lost all sensation.
Equally distributed along the walls, one to either side of a door, were extinguished lamps mounted to the wall, so the only light source was Dan's candle and.
zack stopped cold and quickly tried to formulate another plan
Okay then, we're being followed.
Chris took another lateral swing.
There was a scraping sound at the end of the alley and then a loud crash.
Sure he can.
Pete's beer mug fell off the table and broke.
Chris would be best to wait until night when fewer cops were around and it was darker.
If I do not meet them at work or among my friends and neighbors, then I will not ever meet them.
Two days later his mother knocked on his bedroom door to wake him up but after Chris didn't emerge, she opened the door, peeked in, and saw Chris' empty, well made bed.
But I have digressed and the good reader is anxiously awaiting the tails of my first foray into adventuring.
It looks like they were both cut off.
Me and John talked about some possible strategies.
But on the third time he went to meet a red haired guy in a cafe named Henry.
You seem ta know everyone here.
Regardless of what kind of revenge was being hatched by the Unification, Caylan was forced to acquire some new goons for his activities.
My explorations below ground, and some questions I asked upon my return to the sun, verify a theory I had formed early on.
Watching can't do any harm since, as Roy says, no one will notice him.
Have ya ever had a human invite you into his home?
Susan screamed something which sounded like," No!
Some of these beasts would cross a river or two in order to lose their scent, purposefully travel over rocky ground, and, although I don't believe it myself, leap across wide ravines.
unfortunately there wasn't any rabbit in its hole so zack lost track of the time.
That sure sounded in character.
Mike's need for a house was understandable because Mike had a shelf load of heavy books and wasn't allowed to stay in the factory past sun down.
Tell you what, I'm gonna go sit alone and think things over.
Being able to read and write, I produced the most elegant language which I could poet and nailed several hundred of these masterpieces about Inviroth.
The north end of the city rests upon a high cliff, connected to the southern portion by a gradual slope to sea level.
And even though I consider myself clever, I do not have the imagination to concoct such fantastic creatures and locales as I will relate in future pages, and most of all, I would not with to deceive the noble reader with any lies animated for my own amusement.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life hauling sacks around the city.
As he did not aid in the conversation's progress, I jumped in and fulfilled my part.
Because Mike's station was close to the office, he was able to peak in and see what was going.
News exterior to small towns has a tendency to bypass them entirely, leaving them well behind the times.
As if the removal of the weapon sewed up the hole and made things better and allowed the man to conclude that the would live, he took a step forward, perhaps to thank Chris.
He could see that the cage was up against a roughly cut stone wall that rose and spanned beyond the light's illumination, and that the floor upon which the cage rested was of large flag stones separated by mortar joints, it too expanding beyond the small light's illumination.
The sheets were both empty and too light to be carrying a sequestered cat.
not willing to unearth too many memories, zack put the ears back into the bag.
It was done and Paul could only wait and let time soothe over the mistake.
Rather than reciprocating the approach, the Ferazi stopped in place to await our arrival, and stood their ground for the half hour we required to ride up to their stubborn stand.
For those of you who still grin at my avowed honesty, those who would only peruse these leaflets for entertainment and dismiss all facts as fantasy, I give you a morsel of the truth that is to be exposed:
Mike's head would swing back and forth from one side of the street to the other, and his food bearing head would attempt to keep its edibles next to the swaying head.
From talking with several more Ferazi since this encounter, I have concluded that they all have similarly harsh voices, and even more interesting, put the sentences verb first, followed by the subject and any supporting clauses.
It now sat idle while only a few guards, merely specks, walked back and forth upon the battlements trying to look alert and ready for battle even though only storms had attacked the city walls for the last thousand years.
But then Roy changed his mind.
Chris retreated towards the center of the bed and pulled up the sheets to hide under them, but as he did so, he noticed that his hands were covered with dried blood, now a dark brown color.
He spent a few seconds trying to untie the knot but gave up out of frustration and just coiled up the rope.
He'd even purposely tried to do so several times but could never get anything more abusive than a strong remark out of chris.
Paul put down his cards and broke the silence as he got up and pushed his chair back, the legs scraping against the floor.
he had a beer mug in one hand, but smashing it against the ferazi would only speed up his death.
First thing, they get up and eat and have a food they call breakfast.
Zack fired.
after rummaging through his bag for a bit, until he found both candle and matches, pete struck a match and lit up the candle.
Maybe, but he was sure to be cut up, be arrested by the police, and then get into a whole heap of trouble if any of his other actions were exposed.
Thwack!
The floor turned lake began to boil with activity.
His paranoia finally turning on, Dan wondered if the manager was telling the truth and why he was even bothering to give Dan some information.
Roy had watched at least half a dozen circuses come into Inviroth, set up tents in the potter's field, and unload the cages of wild beasts onto the ground.
I know that they occasionally go out of the city and explore the countryside, but I don't know too much else.
Volume three, West of the Rift.
What's so unusual about that?
Instead of seeing John, Dan expecting him to stop by and get him for dinner, Dan saw a woman in a light blue dress, blond hair, a rather ordinary face, and very tall.
Dan told Ted and John that he would go see the wizard alone, and that they should wait for up to an hour for him, and if he didn't come back they should get the police.
Roy heard very quiet footsteps and watched a cloaked figure glided into his view, directly towards the door.
Having searched every conceivable hiding spot, the two abandoned Mike's apartment and carried the black book to Chris' house where they hoped that Chris would be well enough to read it for them.
It's true that I don't like where I am, but I will get there someday.
Dan had to admit that he was pretty eager to climb the gate.
Last night, the rabbit had almost killed them, and would have if it hadn't recognized Susan, just because of some sort of territorial instinct it had.
Lowering his eyebrows and going on the offensive, the manager began asking his questions.
At that, the servant walked away at his unhurried pace and returned into the mansion.
Although the rewards were welcome at first, after several of such bovine adventures, I discovered that my little house had enough preserved beef to last me a year or more.
The wizard picked up the jars, kneeling down to grab ahold of them, and carried them past Roy and to the podium where he placed the jars down again.
He pulled out the next trick," Why are you haunting me?
After a month with the natives, Fred, some people from the village, and I continued our exploration into even greater mysteries.
Roy remembered to start breathing again now that he was out of immediate danger, but when his took his first breath he smelled something putrid in the air.
Mike might have been found by this evil and dragged to this warehouse to be terrorized by the beast, because Mike had discovered the truth about the underground, unlike other humans, and knew how it was sucking the life out from the world above.
Only the temples and government buildings were larger.
Merchants, traveling in large caravans or ships from the north and east likewise were attracted to Lloyds, perhaps to get news of the world, or to wonder at the treasures which some of their compatriot drinkers claimed to have seen.
I wish there were a lady there though.
Roy then snuck up to the door and opened it a crack, peeked in, but couldn't see only darkness.
Of course, telling him the truth, that the three were going to rescue a Rat from a wizard's mansion, would cause the officer to role over laughing.
I'm Dan Smith, and this is my partner John.
He took a fake sip and then put his drink down on the table, next to Bob's.
Now if I mix the red and the yellow together, then what color does it make?
You're just bluffing.
They have become almost mythical among the common people, but one or two would be seen entering the bar once every month, cloaked from head to foot the whole time they were inside- only identified through the albino characteristics which peeked through their hood or was revealed in the wrist as their sleeve slipped from their gloved hand.
That was, John felt at the moment, a perfectly fine piece of news which meant that the case was over and that they'd get paid, although he'd never heard anyone discussing a fee with the woman.
Only they were unwilling to let their neighbor arrive in it before they themselves as basked in freedom.
Under normal circumstances he wouldn't have even walked into" Bubba's Pub", the name being too retarded, but he was there, without cash, and he desperately didn't want to go outside and experience a spiritual assault again.
As Inviroth is a rather large city, at least a two hours walk in either direction, I deduced that there dwell no fewer than nine hundred such buildings.
I must have bit slightly perturbed at that moment for I vehemently stated that he was wrong and had somehow mistook the map, but my modest transgression was no excuse for the Ferazi's subsequent behavior.
Roy broken in again.
Dan was pulling his sword out of the twitching body when another dane jumped onto Dan and knocked him to the ground.
It opened again just a minute later and a short man with neatly combed black hair, and well dressed with a clean white shirt and blue pants, walked out.
To Chris, a creature who had seen the sun's denied shadows all of his life and failed to notice them, the shadows now revealed their true identity, and made Chris even dreaded to walk into their cold touch.
The sandy haired thug spoke up to Roy," Come on down little rat," and then had an after thought.
Oh well, that's too bad.
There the farmer paid me for my services, not with money( which the farmer's didn't have), but with a portion of the repossessed cow.
no matter who was in the warehouse, the job sounded fun because roy had never watched a warehouse before nor had he done any spying, even though he always did a lot of watching.
Several people did pass them while they walked through the city, causing John's adrenaline to flow through his body, his heart to beat loud enough to be heard, and his throat to dry up.
A little further along Dan stopped to examine a woman's vegetables and glanced back for a familiar face with black hair a few stalls behind them.
So humans can't remember anything so they spend all of their time working in order to pay for it again.
Zack is a guy who hangs around in the corner of Lloyd's and is real obnoxious.
Zack, terrified of what he saw, stood up, allowing the door to pushed the empty seat aside and slam into the floor with a muted thud.
John's bed began to shake in a slow rocking motion which gradually accelerated into the rocking of a torrential sea and nearly tipped over a few times.
The sheets moved again a few seconds later, like some small animal had nestled under the sheets and was now crawling to a more comfortable spot.
Dan had never heard chris make a sound louder than an average person spoke, and in all of the years he had known chris, even when they played together as children, had never heard chris yell or scream.
After spending several days inquiring for the lady's house, I did finally discover it on Garden Street, that picturesque avenue of mansions flowing into the maw of Inviroth Castle.
Mike eventually planned to leave Inviroth and see the world.
Paul pulled out another card from the deck, a X. That was a good card.
I'm here to do them the service I owe them.
Easy.
This might be the guy they were talking about.
In both previous times, Jim headed back to the warehouse, which Ted was watching, while this new man was probably important to whatever Mike was trying to find out.
Beyond them, about one hundred kilometers to the west, rose the southern rift mountain chain, holding up the sky to umbrella the grasses and trees.
He had lit an inset oil burner which Roy had missed before.
It was a long time ago, but they laid siege to the city when it first started up and was small.
Gee.
However, even with the goons' ineptness, they did eventually catch one of the rats, which Caylan now had locked away in his laboratory.
Waking up with a hang over in the morning, he'd finish off what remained on his table or begin a second bottle, making himself the first and last customer of the day, every day, and most likely the one with the highest bar tab.
If I can't see purple, then I won't be able to tell you what symbol you painted, but if purple exists then I'll be able to tell you.
Not wishing to harm any of the hounds, and thus call attention to my presence, and more importantly, damage the lady's property, I reversed direction and only just barely retreated to my lifeline in time.
He hiked up Garden Street to a small cafe about half way up the hill.
" Hey guys," said John from behind Dan.
Roy quickly recoiled it, not so much for fear of falling, but because he didn't wish any of creatures, whose obscure rules of monster ness kept them always underground and prevented them from reaching even a hand above the surface, from grabbing his foot and wrenching him in.
Once again the finger started perusing the page, and once satiated, allowed the hand to flip to the next page where it continued its pointing.
Something ominous was living within the sound, emotion straight out of childhood nightmares.
We just wanna talk, so come on down and you'll get some free candy.
Chris had dreamed that Dan, Chris, the woman, and oddly, a Ferazi and Remozsh, had set out last night to find the woman's missing brother.
Todd's eyebrows lowered.
Although John wasn't consciously thinking rational thoughts, he realized that he accepted the rescue because he wished to rid himself of the ghost, which he had lately been attributing to the wizard, and perhaps also because he missed teasing Roy.
The thatch roof was supported by a series of huge tresses and columns scattered evenly beneath the beams.
The man opened his mouth and slid his jaw from side to side for a moment.
Before verbally retracing my passage into the underworld, I must make known the oath that I have sworn, and many will attest this, that I will maintain accurate records of my explorations, and that in such letters, I will, by all that is sacred, sustain the truth and unbiased focus of my eye.
Mike even had Ted show him which ship the man had visited.
they'd be bookin as soon as they got outta sight of the rabbit.
Roy shivered and his eyes opened in amazement.
Having no moral qualms about the Remozsh's supposed life long goals, and keeping a very open and accepting mind, I decided to approach a band of Remozsh and the garbage can fire they huddled around.
Although no one has ever proven this, those Ferazi with non white fur are rare and are considered noble by the Ferazi culture.
Roy took a look around and picked out the general area, noted a tobacco shop with a huge pipe above its doorway, something unique to remember the area by, and started walking down hill, careful to remember the directions he took.
Suddenly, a vine wrapped around his neck but Roy broke free and dodged away from its further attempts to strangle him.
They were tiger heads mutely roaring, horses thrashing in the quick sand, claws attempting to pull themselves out of a tar pit, hands grasping for aid, oxen exerting to smash through, tentacles flailing, and worse yet, human heads emitting a silent cry before they were sucked back under the flow.
I have had face to face contact with their race on several occasions and have never gotten any method of favorable response.
They all looked the same, with mangy white fur, two long, and menacing eyes.
Roy could only guess that his cage was at an edge of a huge room, but he didn't have any clue where it room was.
Here was this creature, completely clueless, which walked around the city, shoe less, wearing clothing which must have been taken from a refuse pile several years before the rat was born, and not having been washed since.
Zack wasn't sure what was worse, Jason who had no goals and acheived nothing, or the goon squad which had monumental goals and did nothing.
John seemed to remember knowing someone who bounced on beds all of the time but couldn't recall any more than that.
His life was essentially over but he was too cowardly to do anything.
It would have been entirely alone if it weren't for a row of thirty or forty books which were lined up against the wall and watched, like jury examining the proceedings.
If we hang around here we'll end up just as bad.
Roy looked at the body's hands but didn't see any knife or sword in them.
The land was once a beautiful rolling field of grass on top of a cliff that overlooked the pale blue sea.
He replied with another whisper," Just wait man.
No tell.
John knew that it was a weak response, but it'd fly right over the rat's head anyway.
that's why zack considered any ferazi living in inviroth an enemy who was out, body and soul, to harm zack and the people of inviroth.
at first the remozsh took it to be a hand, but then the shape cleared and turned into a remozsh's head.
The one which Caylan had caught was probably supposed to keep quiet about what it was doing, but it had obviously told at least one fellow rat, because the gray one seemed to be stopping by for a chat.
Climbing down the stairs brought the group into a long hallway running through the middle of the second floor with doors symmetrically aligned along the passage.
No answer came.
The woman, who was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand, unfolded it and gave it to Dan, who, in his dazed state, didn't know why she did so because Dan couldn't read.
However, the Remozsh may have let a cat into the apartment for some unknown reason.
all of the ferazi knew of the nightly hunts and were very cautious at night, always keeping an ear half cocked just in case they heard anything strange outside, just like any wild animal did.
by the time that zack got half way down the alley he could see the shadow of the rabbit crouch down, jump up towards a roof top two stories above, grab wildly for any kind of hand hold, just a meter short of the edge, and then fall back down.
That was a big problem, especially since most of the insane or" eccentric" people John had met thought that they themselves were perfectly normal, and that if anything, everyone else who didn't believe and act like themselves should be put in the nut house.
He had to get that crossbow from todd.
Neither of us is stupid enough to try this again.
zack hated to follow up such a cowardly act with his own version but he could see no other choice if he wanted a chance of living.
Even though the corridor was completely dark, Roy ran into it at full speed, fearing the worse fate which was pursuing behind him.
The wolf pack took over from where their master left off, but at a much more invigorating pace.
We think it's Mike's diary.
It was huge, and its emptiness compounded upon its size to make it additionally so.
Roy was totally helpless, hanging onto the back of the Ferazi with all his effort and rapidly being carried further from the surface than he had ever wished.
Even Paul's room mate, Pete, was gone tonight, out with his girlfriend.
Chris wasn't so easily swayed, because he had begun the fight with the man-- What was his name?
Chris was not yet awake enough to be absolutely sure.
Since John had only experienced the ghost on one night, Dan would easily assume that it was all a dream.
once the beast was killed, they hang its pelt up in a somewhat public spot to spook the other rabbits and give them a serious hint that they should get out of the city, someplace where they don't belong.
Not being the cruel sort, I cut the Remozsh's bonds and it scurried up the stairs as fast as its legs would take it, never to be seen again.
Hell, it was worth a shot.
About one o'clock John hit upon the idea of checking out the dresser for anything hidden.
I told him so, insisting that he must be mistaken, and that his home must be someplace on the left side of the map where the Ferazi kingdoms where, and that I didn't know his home's specific location, and that's why I was asking.
The talk wouldn't disgust Zack so much if the goons would ever have the guts to undertake such a journey, but for the most part, they were afraid of even walking beyond their own bedrooms.
He took one night and visited Susan in order to inform her that the job was done and that there was nothing else that Dan and John could do.
Someday, the cancer lying in the human city would be either torn or burned down, cleared up, and then reclaimed by its rightful inhabitants.
Unfortunately for Lloyd, when he finally wound his way through the city and down to the docks he discovered every available pier clogged with unused sea faring vessels.
He looked up for an instance, and then returned his attention to the magic book and began to leaf through it.
Ted was one of roy's friends, the two having worked in several different jobs together, most recently the one at Lloyd's.
Once his claw had slowed its travels, I began to point out some of the places which I had previously mentioned in my travels, and where we were headed, the Great Salt Sea.
Beyond was farmland, wilderness, the sea, and mountains.
But even worse than that, John was now being visited by a poltergeist, a creature which only existed in fairy tales.
Maybe Caylan would not torture Roy after all.
But they were too distant and too slow from eating to capture another of my shoes.
Instead he had visited her first, and couldn't get more than a few words from his later hosts.
I also need clothes and shelter, and if I'm ever going to get across the sea, then I need money to pay for a ship ride.
The anteceding chapters describe my adventures underground, revealing the life beneath your feet, those whose roof you tread daily upon, people and creatures whose names have never seen the sun.
He seemed to be awake, especially since he had waken up from one dream already.
John suspected that Dan was getting back at him for being slow to climb the gate.
" Can't miss it," was Dan's quote of the day.
Dan turned around to see the wizard's gloating smile, and then watched it sour as the Wizard's left arm sprung up into the air, holding only an empty shirt.
And although boasts about oneself or one's people are generally considered rude and unbecoming of a gentleman, I put the weight of my reputation upon the quality of Inviroth, and attest that every shining dome and window of Inviroth deserves the attention that I deliver to it.
As a kid, he had tried eating the whole plant, including the stems, only to get one of the worst stomach aches in memory.
" Hey everyone, look who's here," said Zack.
Ah ha!
When you're a herbivore, almost everything that you see in the natural world is edible and life giving, since most of the world is covered with grass and trees.
She might even, through her awareness, discover some missed blood spots, and in the end she would confront her son with unanswerable questions, forcing Chris succumb to her pleading and divulge the carnage.
They even had a full suit of armor and' t had a sword hole in it right here," and Roy pointed to a spot just to the left of his heart.
Dan looked and saw the Remozsh curled up into a small ball on the wall side of a circus cage.
This was where the showdown would happen.
Not only was he working for us, but if Roy talks we're in trouble.
Todd bolted for the doorway and was just crossing the threshold when something sharp hit his back and pushed him forward a step.
He bent up and tried to untie his feet but failed to loosen the bonds.
slowly, roy opened the shutter, being very careful not to let it creak too loudly and give him away, and always watching to see if any light turned on inside.
However, I don't know any minorities, so I have nothing to judge them by, so I use television as my yard stick.
Chris felt as though a whole score of evil eyes were laid upon him and planning his murder.
Roy would have readily given up John's name or address to a complete stranger.
" How the hell should I know," was the only answer he got back.
The best moral that I can think of is," The world is a magical place with no prescribed set of endings," and that is a fairly incredulous one.
Luckily, though, no one had seen Dan or John walk through the streets dressed like outmoded heros of the past, or contemporary crazies escaped from the city's insane asylum.
Since the present was the best time for action, Zack threw caution to the wind.
The dream was so realistic and detailed.
Instead of changing course, I sprinted for the nearest tree, making sure not to lose my bag of creativity.
Chris' victim continued his crying for some time, occasionally inserting weak coughs into his sorrow pangs.
John followed suit but it was some time before he heard and then saw someone walking towards them.
zack circled around to the back of the creature so that he could make the killing blow from a much saver vantage point, away from the ferazi's claws.
If I stay in Inviroth I'm gonna be doing that for the rest of my life, just like my father.
There wasn't anything on top of the dresser either, except a doily which his mother had bought and put there one day.
He looked down at his stomach where Chris' sword was still impaled, about a quarter of the blade hidden in the man's flesh.
Ted yawned.
Roy had dozed off on the tree and was just on the verge of falling.
I don't like the word," ignore "
The footsteps persisted for a while, getting closer all of the while.
roy saw nothing but he smelled enough to give him the picture.
He opened the ink well and then spent a few minutes writing some lines onto the paper, pausing occasionally to think.
Almost all of them were still empty, dinner not yet having arrived.
While the wizard was slowly working his way down the lights, Roy counted the tomes to be beyond a hundred, giving up at the astronomical number.
He painted three stripes on the wood, each one using a different color paint.
He heard nothing except for the hushed whispers of the trees, and the singing of birds, each bird to his own tree.
asked Dan apologetically.
As usual, he had to pass up a lot of jobs because they required a cart and mule.
The demon, or the magic, had somehow entranced him
If you can't ever accomplish your own goals.
The dog great dane began to bit at Dan's neck.
Curt slipped his lower lip forward and raised his eyebrows in his unique facial expression, which as far as Zack could ever figure, was made by Curt to mock people.
He could not help watching the spectacle of turmoil caused by the heads, arms, and bodies leaping half way out of the whole before being pulled back.
The Remozsh which she was yelling to turned around and ran over.
Chris raised his shield, tightened the grip on his sword, and resumed his charge, sprinting towards the unchallenged enemy.
Would ya ever pay twenty dollars ta have some more?
Dan, glad that he had no dinner yet, closed the sack up and put it outside, closing the door behind him so that none of the odor would waft in.
It was too late now though.
" There's always the posters," spoke chris in his usually soft and meek voice.
The rat joyfully kicked its legs against the bed's edge, jumped off, and opened the door.
Lloyd, however, did manage to divine an equally exciting occupation which had the potential of providing a good life if he were as intelligent as he knew himself to be.
zack returned his thoughts to the steps necessary for convincing mike why all ferazi needed to be killed.
zack gave the crossbow to russ, who took aim, waiting for the rabbit to land, and fired.
" Do you mind," stabbed Zack and he picked the card up to look at it, making sure that Curt's peeking was thwarted.
Caylan took another sip of tea and tried to think of some sort of magic he could perform which would not leave such traceable residues.
What is their pantheon like?
I learned their language, a curious set of words totally unlike ours, their culture, and the ways of the underground.
They were the same people who talked to their plants, thought that every natural event was an omen, and who believed that a deck of cards could predict the future.
No amount of bribe would pay off Roy.
the armor made him look thirty pounds heavier and a hell of a lot more muscular.
My grandparents came from a Polish sub culture.
When I was not much more than a boy, having absolutely no common sense beneath my hair, I took it upon myself to become a great hero and adventurer.
Perhaps even a wooden hand would grab his arm or leg and Roy would shriek as loudly as he could, only to be muffled by the oak's own groaning and grating.
Chris observed that the enemy's clothes were soiled and shredded country clothes.
Hidden behind the eruptions was a chest, muscular arms, and an angular head, all summing to several stories in height.
He would watch the last lights of the dying flames and enjoy the rhythms and gyrations of the celestial dancers.
The only other ways to get money are to steal it- which we aren't gonna do- or go to work for ourselves.
But Roy knew that Mike never told and expected to hear a scream of frustration come from the grand dragon after his plans were foiled.
He said that tomorrow night is some sort of ceremonial day for wizards and that Caylan should be busy doing his hocus pocus stuff.
Dan asked in earnest.
I spent a minute staring at each of them, and since the elderly man was likewise staring at me, I made extreme faces at the paintings, some of disgust and others of enjoyment.
Roy kept on running as fast as he could, but the others outpaced him and left him behind in an empty chamber, right in the middle of the sand flats.
The black haired one had a bag with something in it draped over his shoulder.
just then zack heard a garbage can at the end of the alley tip over, some footsteps, and a few more cans got bumped.
The Ferazi extended his neck, took one look beyond the edge, and then froze absolutely still.
So how should Dan break the news to a Ferazi?
But the chance of getting away was still too slim, especially with the crossbow.
Finishing that page, Susan scanned back several more, until she stopped and raised here eyebrows.
Even though Dan, the Ferazi, and John had been fully cloaked, John was worried that the three would be stopped by some nosy police officer, and would have nothing to explain away the swords strapped to their sides, their armor, and a Ferazi riding a black horse.
He had, after all attended many public hanging and intently watched the criminals which were to be executed.
Don't move or I'll throw the rat to the demon!
No better place has been fashioned than a house of drinking.
Chris interrupted, his voice much quieter than those of the previous minute.
what would he say to him?
While this in itself could form an interesting adventure, no one in the village was willing to pay me even a cent to discover why their nemesis had disappeared, and were happy enough to turn a blind eye to benificial news.
Zack backed up a step and held his chair as an impromptu shield, constantly trying to judge where the Ferazi would strike.
Its claws were slowly inching their way towards Dan's neck and getting ready to grab hold.
Unfortunately, words form but tiny mirrors, and no matter how truly they are positioned or how many shards a glued together, I am only capable of assembling a fragmented image of the true beauty.
Zack tired of waiting.
He may not have even wanted to fight Chris at all, but wished to make peaceful amends.
Because of all my thoughts, worries, conjectures, and stories, my parents thought me insane from too much imagination.
John almost laughed.
Many a time I have asked myself and others why the race has such a pervasive fear of what's beneath our feet, but no one has ever been able to answer.
Were they the feet of his pursuers?
The downward sloping passage began as a rough cavern, perhaps formed by some swelling underground river, but as our journey descended, about a day of traveling I would say, the tunnel began to look less natural, and took on distinct traits of having been chiseled, or perhaps chewed, from the earth.
Since Paul didn't care to hang out with anybody else tonight, he was forced to stay home and keep company with a deck of cards and a fire.
Who the bloody hell are you!
Well, they were both right, as near as John could tell.
Chris could always take a walk down to the police station and tell them that Mike was kidnapped and that Chris knew where Mike was.
Just like Chris knew the man, Chris' dream knowledge also told him that this wasn't a man but a specter.
Roy decided to follow the villain into the depths of the earth for his friend, even if it meant his own death and torture.
After about five minutes of pulling, two upraised arms emerged from the pit.
Although this is of academic interest, it is not as earth shattering as the wonders that I discovered, an entire labyrinth of tunnels and caverns beneath our feet, extending throughout the entire Empire and beyond, and know one knows why they exist.
Maybe the discoloration would be better ascribed to that of a mangy white dog whose skin looks as if it were greased in lard and never cleaned or fluffed up because of the condition of the canine's mind.
Roy got up and then glanced at the street he was on, took a left and then a right at the first obscure alley.
" This is Inviroth, silly," answered Ted.
The wizard smiled, let go of Roy and walked to the podium, where he looked over the tome even more intently than before.
As the woman headed back, Dan pulled out four dollars and handed her the coins.
Mike would threaten to take his business elsewhere if the keep continued his protestations, and all of the while that Mike was with Roy, he would never enter and establishment without Roy's being capable of doing so also.
When susan got to the top of the landing she walked in and lit a lamp inside.
We tried joining the military.
Caylan seemed satisfied with his answer and stooped down to continue his painting.
Mike had orange hair, although human's called it red, and a freaked face which was continually smiling, almost as if some sort of masterful prank had just been pulled, and Mike was wallowing in the joke.
John, holding the sword in hand for protection, waited awhile longer to see if anything happened, but after a few minutes of inactivity John's comb suddenly flew out of nowhere and hit him on his shoulder.
And, if in the process, roy figured, he did become the mans friend and was given some of the juicy meat that he was offering to all his other friends, roy's hunger would soon subside.
So, when dawn awoke, I grabbed myself some chalk and a lantern, just like the farmer had said, and stopped by Angus' farmhouse, where I convinced the stoic farmer to assume a new profession, if only for the day, and show me through the tunnels and to the Remozsh skeletons.
John wasn't sure if Chris had floated off in his dreamland, or if he had fallen to earth too quickly.
He tumbled to the front and right, reaching out for some support from his killer, but unable move his arm fast enough to catch Chris as he stepped away.
It at least explained the cause of the nightmare, but the thought of a thief wandering around his apartment wasn't any better.
After flipping back about three pages, she stopped and read more slowly.
That was a mistake of Caylan's part, since he had lost some trustworthy men as a result.
About half way down the new page, Caylan retracted his hand and walked to the far shelf corner where he picked up a large paint brush.
I bet they had a statue of Derek Halfstar up there.
The facts had already convinced Dan, and hopefully they'd convince the Ferazi enough to help in the rescue just in case a fight broke out.
The foot tried to push Todd forward and it seemed like the spear was pulled backwards.
I was sitting up in my bedroom one night, musing over famous tales, when my father ascended the stairs from his shop and informed me of a strange guest at the front door.
before the foundation of the empire, in March, just when the cherry trees were beginning to bloom, Amroth and his loyal host boarded their vessels and sailed west.
Dan and John had tried to think of several excuses for their odd dress and companion, and had spent several hours locked in a room discussing them.
Sadly, when Dan and John wound their way to Chris' door with book in hand, Chris' demeanor had not changed.
the Ferazi uttered an unintelligible sound, and then followed it with," done".
Dan decided that it was better to lose his follower rather than capture him, and took a right on the next crowded road.
All of his relatives showed up to the gathering and spent the week enjoying each other's company and repaying old debts of kindness.
The kings averted their armies from the battlefield and stationed them within their cities to no avail, for the dragon could not be shot down by arrows and it safely incinerated any city that it wished.
That didn't work very well.
The little romp causing thousands of dollars damage, all of which had to be remitted.
Holding his candle in his right hand, John slowly turned the doorknob with his left until it stopped, and then slowly pushed the door open.
The shock of hitting his arm against the wall caused his hand to loosen its grip and left the sword go flying into the hallway.
These, in their pre ordained quest for the sky, likewise spawned progeny and produced an entangled sculpture of gnarled branches which were forever retreating away from their origin and towards the sky.
I've just gotta keep my eyes open for anything interesting.
The meeting ended at that point, and Dan went his way, hurrying on home so that he could count the money that was in the purse.
Chris looked around for a moment and saw the Ferazi waving to him.
That's where they took Mike, and that's why they only came in and out of that door, and you couldn't find them after they'd gone in."
This, of course, makes no sense either, since no one would spend the effort to drag a screaming and kicking Remozsh underground so far when bringing it in only half a meter would have the same effect.
Having acquired a reputation, I would get a great many contracts to seek out these fugitive bovines and return them to their owners, and although bovine history paints these creatures as incredibly stupid and easier to track than a galloping heard of buffalo, I discovered what every farmer in the region knew, that these escapees were more clever than their heard instinct would imply.
Are you the famous Derek Halfstar whose deeds I've heard so much about?
Maybe the man would have given up if Chris had given him a chance to talk, or maybe Chris could have just knocked the sword out of the man's hands.
Stop grinning Zack.
The roots of this tree were solid and firmly implanted into the soil, their only goal to sustain the rest of the body, and perhaps to trip any transient humans below.
Roy hoisted himself on the rope up a hands length.
Even though the Emperor had signed a truce with the Ferazi kingdoms a few years ago, and so far it had almost completely ceased the border skirmishes, we were not willing to chance a friendly approach being misjudged has a charge.
Dan seemed to hear it too because he plugged his ears for a second just to make sure that the sound was real.
It was an enormous parcel with a three storied mansion presiding in the center, surrounded by exquisite gardens of shapely trees and hued flowers, a truly magnificent sight, and I recommend that the reader delve in for a visit.
The man approached Roy and the stairs faded into darkness.
" His name is Ted," said the Remozsh annoyingly.
You could never tell how people would react when they finally acquired the dreams which they sought.
It did not even to hang suspended like a droplet of water.
guard didn't even stop me.
zack made one final kick and the door burst open.
Still Roy refused to look, and would rather be taken unawares by the monster than watch it creep up on him.
he stood, cornered at the end, panting and supporting himself by holding his hands to his bent knees, occasionally having a chance to wet his dry mouth.
That was not a very pleasant analogy, although perhaps true.
They leave nothing in their wake but parched earth and stubble.
The only problem was that Roy, to John's knowledge, didn't know where John lived and only knew John's first name.
That leaves Mike caught in a feud between the Wizard's guild and the Technos.
Not having any external stimulus, John's mind returned to its self evaluation.
Well I have a mind ta use one.
Shut up," was John's curt reply, who didn't expect the rat to obey him.
Then, holding up Curt' limp body by his hair, the monster dragged Curt towards the door and behind the table, hidden from Zack's eyes, but he heard the sound of Curt's boyd being dragged stop when it was close to the doorway.
He had never thought of doing such a thing.
The Ferazi's eyes had even stopped blinked, and seemed glazed over.
He too was afraid of what his family would say about a Human friendship, and hence an association with the enemy.
Dan showed up at the appointed time and place, and met the nameless manager in a shadowed alley.
It's got a hedge around it and some guard dogs, but we can get around those with some work.
During the entire day John was exhausted and there were several times when he just wanted to lie down on the ground and sleep for a few hours, but he soon was given another task to do and didn't have any time to consider his predicament.
Now the cop would be able to comment on the reality of the rat's costume.
While he watched, Dan thought that he saw the shape beneath move, but was uncertain because its form was so ill defined.
This, in addition to the dim yellow glow which the reliefs emitted was odd, but somehow it all seemed to make sense.
" Good day sir," said the butler as he surveyed Dan's clothing.
His sword tip lowered to the ground, eyes widened, and ears perked up slightly.
Besides Mike?
" Okay John, it's your turn," whispered John's ex friend.
Being dressed as a judge, with wig, robes, and gavel, I proclaimed, for judges always proclaim," I am Judge Moffet representing the Inviroth Sculpture and Painting society.
Zack followed up and claimed the other ear as a prize.
Now shut up or I'll have you killed.
zack's grandfather, identified by his clothing and other personal affects, had a gaping hole left by a spear which replaced where his heart had been.
He had noted that last night's dream was a strange one but didn't bother to dwell on it, but was startled by something else.
You're absolutely right.
My first attempt at advertising, something which every upstart adventurer is in need of, was a sure success, or so I thought.
'Cause I don't have enough money.
Being ignorant of any official knot for such an occasion, he used the same knot he'd been taught when he was four by his father, slipped the loop around the chimney and let the rope down.
When he had first gotten the rope it was a full seventeen, but every hunt shaved a little bit off its length.
When ever a strong storm riles up the waters and some unlucky merchant ship, crossing the turmoil, is rent asunder, all of its contents, crates, barrels, crewmen, food, and riches merely float upon the saline water in a large island of miscellany until the currents deposit them on shore, although some wrecks have washed upon shore which had disappeared more than a hundred years before.
John was already waiting outside, sitting on his own horse, when Dan grabbed the last of his belongings and walked down the stairs.
I've called this meeting first off to brush up on what we know so far, and secondly to come up with a plan to find Mike's murderer.
He heard a few voices drifting up through the portal, and though he couldn't understand what they were saying, their words being very muted, Chris did recognize a few different voices, probably two or three.
As Ted walked away south down the deserted street Roy noticed three thug looking humans start running towards Ted.
At times even, a bold creature would toss pebbles our way, or steal food from the mules' backs, but we never spied anything, until one day( or night) we followed the sound of a brook or underground river.
Yes sir ree.
He first peeked in with his head and saw only darkness, and then gradually let the candlelight reveal the room.
Although it is little used today since the Empire eliminated city state rivalries, the majesty and power of the castle still bear the mark of Arsellus' son and would buckle the knees of any invader.
it had a few gashes and some claw marks, but they only scratched the surface.
Baseball hats go on the other way.
Everything in the world can be torn apart, and all of its individual parts hint at what is larger.
roy heard another step and a dark object appeared around the corner at the height of roy's head.
Remozsh will not ever voluntarily go underground, and if they are questioned as to why, they merely recount stories of subterranean monsters told to them by their mothers, rather much the stuff of fairy tales.
Well, now let me tell you.
That wes obvious;
Todd wished he could revel in their dances and chants eternally, but sleep beckoned him.
Why can't I?
When John was older, if he ever lived that long, he would look back and remember tonight as one of the stupidest things which John had ever done, even worse than when he had gotten himself wasted and tried to pick a fight with a city guard.
I tried a few times ta jest walk right in, but jest like you I was grabbed every time.
Roy gave the rope a tug, but it didn't budge at all.
She took his hand and led him across the sand flats, at first at a brisk walk, but after another shudder it turned into a run, tugging on Roy's hand rather than leading him.
Failing to ever get a hold of that Remozsh again, we abducted another one, Tim, tied it up, and carried it underground.
I never saw one leap right at me before.
She seemed very nervous, but Chris felt just as much so.
" Oh, if it ain't Dopey," said Ron in a very sarcastic way.
Two minutes later a floorboard creaked.
Ferazi just think differently and have different needs than Humans.
If he faced south, Roy could see the mason's road reach to the edge of a precipice and then plummet off the edge, along with the trees and bushes.
Chapter sixteen
He was the only man who had a chance of evicting the serpent from the city.
Roy considered watching the door a bit longer, but he was too hungry and too disappointed that Henry had disappeared.
For a few moments I feared myself to be a fly incapable of escape, while spiders crept above and below me, ready to sedate my body and suck out my life.
Susan's mother walked out of the room and slowly closed the door so that it wouldn't bang.
from the instant that the first kick came to the door, a hunting team only had about twenty seconds before nearby rabbits had awakened, taken up arms, and were running out of the apartments in order to surround and massacre the hunters.
A light grey color looks pristine against a black background but it obviously tarnished when placed against one that is white.
Roy ran as hard as he could, over neatly cut grass, stone pathways, and through a large flower garden with benches symmetrically placed along the pathway.
The only choice seemed to be an assault on their hideout and a rescue of Mike.
Even though the best of the lot, such an excuse was riddled with holes, so much so that Dan and John came up with a fail safe plane.
If you think of yourself as a failure then what else is there to do?
People crowded around the cages in order to get a better look at the wild animals locked inside, cougars, lions, wolves, and tigers, safe in the knowledge that the bars were impenetrable.
But before he reshuffled the cards and dealt them all, Paul remembered the coolness and his mental notes of just a few minutes ago that he should build up the fire.
Well, Jim have it to Henry, and they both got up 'n left.
You gave the crossbow to that psycho!
Chris decided that he should chase the remozsh down to see what was the problem.
John returned to the present and continued to size up the rabbit, hoping that if he stared at it long enough he could force some sort of reaction, even a eye twitch.
Everyone in Inviroth knows that the very richest people are buried in the Cliff End Cemetery, overlooking the sea, so I made straight for that, not even adjourning to shed by judicial garb.
The Remozsh tried to get as close as possible to the action, but could do no more than lean against the bars and stick his nose through;
You are absolutely correct sir.
Their bones had not been laying their for centuries, either, but, from my best guess, nearly two millennium, since the bones were nearly submerged by a layer of dust, and, as I will later describe, I found corroborating tales that tell of the Remozsh' passage through the underground two thousand years ago.
Roy was once again sitting outside the warehouse tonight, using the over turned garbage can as a makeshift house with all of the amenities, including a pantry.
He needed another card and was willing to risk running over.
Why did you kidnap him then?
He wiggled it around a bit and pulled it out along with a clump of plaster, cleared away the debris from the sharpened double blade, and held it right in front of russ' face.
Several years back I had tried this on a dare, and would call it one of the more stupid things I have tried, almost as dumb as licking frozen iron,( which I also did) for the mail is so cold that it puts one to shivering within seconds as the metal cools off the body quicker than water.
The effect of my Polish ancestry is so small that it only shows in my last name and what kind of food I eat at family reunions.
Just a parting word about the Remozsh because they are little mentioned in the upcoming chapters, their occupations having been less interesting than the underground denizens.
Why would they?
In a state of disbelief at my grandiose claim, the reader is preparing to close this volume and place it on his shelf, never to read another page.
Dan got out of his bed, navigated around the pitch black room, and headed for the door, barely visible from the light entering the window.
He took the risks.
If this job were as big as the diary suggested, with powerful guilds plotting against the other, then Dan's life necessarily had two alternative outcomes- death or success.
It was pier pressure, John supposed.
And even though the two brothers were no longer alive to lead their people, benevolent rulers continued to maintain amiable relations between the two brother cities, working together to foster trade and protection.
Roy would find ornate boxes, colorful paintings, books, glass jars, ceramics, clothing, hats, musical instruments, jewelry, and wood contrivances from all over the Empire, and Mike would explain to Roy where these came from and how they were made, and if he didn't have any idea, Mike would inquire with the shop keeper as to their origin.
Ignoring any further introductions, even those of my comrades who had so gallantly volunteered me to be their spokesman, I proceeded to questions which were no idle chat, but of whose answers I was deeply curious, and whose responses had so long been empty of answers that the questions still echoed around the voids.
A" factory" eliminates the expensive guild member from the construction, requiring only a disfigured kind of apprentice.
I finished with an extravagant bow that was only sullied by my missing hat.
He might even die on the rack or in the iron maiden, but he wouldn't give up his friends.
How often does one actually look at grass and notice what shade of green it is?
Mike had uncovered a great crime which was about to be committed by the guild, maybe even a plotted assassination of the Duke, or a smuggling enterprise.
Do you think you could show us where he disappeared?
Roy didn't know, nor could he even begin to guess, not ever having a" home" which he could call his own, or ever caring if he did.
The only reason we're worth hiring is that we're so desperate that we'll do anything.
anything which would keep a grudge in battle would surely bare it into peace time.
Okay, but should we give up the job because of that?
John thought it was pretty gross, but he wasn't going to do much complaining because if the wackos of the world didn't have the rabbits to go after, they'd be hunting humans for sport.
We know our own section of the mural too well, so well that we have ceased to notice the colors that once were so vibrant, but which have now faded from familiarity.
When I have since encountered Ferazi, especially on less volatile terms than my current adventure, I have requested that they teach me at least part of the tongue but all have severely rebuked my request.
For such services, you stated that you would pay me with a jewel which you displayed before me.
However, experts also believe that the Emph Kelzar race control the Technological Unification Organization, and their albino skin has never been seen in Inviroth for several hundred years.
As far as John could tell, neither Dan nor the Ferazi had any kind of firm plan which would get them into mansion, and John certainly hadn't come up with any ideas because he was hoping that without a way to get into the mansion, Dan would give up right now.
Dan's attention avoided the escaping souls and wandered to the base of the creature, where the torso should have encountered ground.
This time he asked Roy a question," Do you have any more questions?
Mike could not recognize the" colors" of music well enough to play, or even appreciate music.
She said something in a voice too quiet to decipher, and after a moment, walked back down the stairs.
All the while Roy would jog next to Mike's quick stride and trying to maneuver, see which direction Mike was looking at the moment, and spy what he was looking at all at the same time.
The Ferazi's fur had turned from white into a pink and red fur, evoking almost a festival like atmosphere.
Being affronted by so much splendor I forgot my tongue and failed to respond in any form of verbal communication.
He gave essentially no reply to any of these questions even though I'm sure that he understood their meaning perfectly.
The other, which occupied more of Dan's time, crept up Dan's chest, circumnavigated Dan's shoulders and arms, and ultimately found its home around his neck.
Sometimes even, the market is a scene for a macabre entertainment where one watches a here to fore neighbor be stabbed in the back, or perhaps hung from a tree.
Well then come on inside where I have some fresh lamb chops I have inside.
Weakened from blood loss, the man's leg gave way at his first step.
This is the first priority since we, most of all, need to find Mike.
Thinking back over the last few years, Chris could not remember when he had been so elated.
Now we have ta climb this bush and get him.
She does that routine whenever she wants to marry me off.
Dan was handed another purse of money and thanked for a job well done.
Although the underground structures had been tampered with somewhat, and appeared to be occasionally inhabited by thieves, the Ferazi city still existed underneath Inviroth and could be reborn with little difficulty.
The wizard's voice was so loud that Roy could imagine that Caylan was standing right next to the cage and chanting.
He could climb higher and wait till help did arrive.
My band and I rode towards the group of five Ferazi, and while we were still some distance away, we were spotted.
Two enemies may walk into a pub, but once there they are equaled and the business of mutual extinction is waylaid till another time.
In all my tales, and in all my adventures to which you, the reader, have been privy, my words always expound and return to the past, my origin and my raising, which I believe are of key importance to my character and honor.
Since Pete had the door already, there was no point in getting up, and Paul didn't particularly feel like saying anything, so he just sat at his table and didn't even turn around.
Perhaps instead, the cloaked figure was a member of the Thieves' guild who had come here to check on his mates.
" Just climb it," commanded the dark haired guy.
John must have been only six years old then and the world seemed like it would never end.
I think that it's too late to do it tonight so I'll go there with Roy the first thing tomorrow morning.
Todd watched the fire fairies dance against the living room walls and then slowly fade away, along with everything else.
He proceeded to laboriously drag the volume, almost as tall as Roy and as thick as Roy's head, over to the podium.
John felt that it looked more like a starving dog's chest than that of a powerful fighter.
Although a burst of the viscous liquid would charge from out of the body, its connection to the whole was so strong that it could never successfully free itself enough to fall to the ground.
In their hurry to get away from the wizard's mansion, and their mental exhaustion, Dan and John had both forgotten to cover themselves up with their cloaks.
Mike helped him out a few years ago and since then they've become friends.
Does he have a silver chain around his neck?
Roy excepted that he would hear rocks loudly grating upon one another but all he could discern was the wizard's booming voice uttering some incomprehensible phrases.
Nothing stirred beyond the murmuring tree leaves and singing birds, no squirrels, no deer, and most of all, no humans.
Meanwhile, Dan imitated the rabbit and likewise stared blankly at a wall, but at least his eyes shifted around from time.
Roy could hear some sort of scraping and scrambling behind him by the time he reached the passage.
I can tell, you're full' v it now, just like the time you' claimed' to have made it with Margaret.
The head was an attached orb of glowing plasma, containing ill defined and hazy borders which rolled around as if stretching on an overly flexible neck.
Roy tried to run with her but could hardly keep up, no matter how fast he moved his legs, and shortly he lost grip of his mother's hand and she sped away without him.
As Roy saw it, houses had two purposes, nighttime quarters for sleeping protected of the rain and snow, and a storage room for all of the objects which people own.
the skin and hair which was on his head was torn from its flesh and taken by the ferazi as a war trophy, along with both of his hands.
Sure, but I'm not forcing you into this and I can't pay anymore.
Even I began to believe so, and towards the end I gave up hope of the lady's appearance because I had discovered her secret.
Ya didn't need ta tear' t off.
zack had expected some bloodshed by this point.
It all has to do with their poor memory.
When the trio reached the mansion they gathered underneath a dark window.
Wow, Roy thought, an entire ship could be placed in the room, more like a fleet, and they would all stand upright in dry dock except for their masts.
Next to Roy's prison, about three meters away, was a small oil lamp which enabled Roy to see anything in the cage, but didn't reveal much more of his location beyond that.
How'd ya do' t?
Someplace he had either seen or heard of a jade sword, Where?
The armor did attract a lot of attention and was working extremely well, but unfortunately, one moring when I stepped outside with gentlemanly plans to give the straw a rest, I discovered the armor missing.
A hand grabbed Chris' shoulder and gently turned him around.
Roy sat and watched the lights climb skyward, wondering what kind of person who would wear a black cloak.
Realizing that Bob's hand was sweaty, John quickly detached his hand and wiped it on his pants.
Although he had spent many hours watching the animals in the cages pace back and forth and continually try to squeeze through the bars, Roy never imagined actually being locked in the cage himself.
He'd have to stop by Smiley's tomorrow and pick up another wheel barrow worth.
They were just regular guys, John though sarcastically, who had a whooping time of going around the city and doing some rabbit hunting, cutting themselves a trophy off their kill.
What's goin' on?
The butler, imagining that he had learned something profound that day, produced a stool and removed the artistry so that I could judge the back side, even though my real intentions were to see what was behind it.
Having plenty of carrion, I repeated this process, and over several pieces I managed get the hounds' appetites, and their respective jaws, far away.
Natural fur would be very advantageous to every warrior.
He wouldn't say what was being stolen or why it was important and only told us that the person behind it was Caylan, a member of the Wizard's Guild.
Of course, Roy did the same when Mike was reading a book or explaining some sort of intricacy about the Empire because Mike kept on mentioning people and places which Roy had never heard of, and the story wouldn't be complete without a full sketch of the denizens.
On the opposite wall was a locked door which led to the landlord's house, the apartment actually being a room of the house, which was rented out because the owner's need some extra money.
The few ferazi which lived in the city, perhaps numbering several hundred, always lived together in ghettos, places in the worst parts of the city where the rents were cheapest and the landlords were willing to rent to the enemy.
Zack had to have a crossbow tonight or he'd have to call off the hunt because there was no way that he was going after a once hunted ferazi with nothing but a few knives and clubs.
Towards the center of the cavern was a torch and some sort of black object.
then, he'd round up everyone and send them off to get weapons.
Once they're done with that its back ta work until dark.
I saw it's claw come out of the pit, and it started running after me, and it.
Ouch!
Dan decided that one day he'd have to stop John's attitude problem.
He used to hide, or at least stuff, lots of his toys underneath it so that hey would stay safe, and also that they wouldn't clutter up the room.
The straw dummy was used in substitute for me as I was not about to stand outside my parents' door day and night dressed as a cast iron wood stove.
She would wonder if he had run away because of her, or her questioning would circle around onto herself, blaming her son's disappearance or death on her own imagined transgressions.
Ted, frustrated by Roy, tried to explain," Don't ya understand?
Zack then slid off the table and then hit Curt's chair, which slid aside and let Zack land on the floor back first.
Dan led the two around a quarter of the mansion and to a one story addition of some sort, probably a kitchen.
I've got to get back to work but I'll continue looking through for any more information.
The assassins may have been from a rogue element of the Unification Organization.
Dan was trying to just that, rehashing his previous list of possibilities and eliminating those which were tried and those which were eliminated by his failed meeting with Caylan.
Zack tried to formulate his plan of action for when the beast charged him with a swinging long sword, trying to estimate how long it would take to reach him, if anyone would luckily( for Zack) get in its way, and how Zack would get out of the bar since it was impossible to outrun a Ferazi.
Nope, not that I recall, though I can say that I didn't get a chance ta look at them all, there bein' so many.
Dan didn't particularly want to ask Chris' father to read through the diary, since that would intrigue him enough to ask questions about what Dan, John, and Chris were doing.
On the other side of the hedge Roy could hear the sandy haired man yelling at his companion.
Heck, he'd probably turn ya into a newt.
It sounded colloquial enough.
This lead to a dead end too high for Roy to climb so the Remozsh looked around for a place to hide and found some garbage cans against the wall.
Since I am a learned man and know that two Remozsh could coincidentally dislike the underground while thousands of others thought nothing of it, I tried this same experiment some twenty times over years, abducting Remozsh from different cities and sexes, but all of them had virtually the same reaction.
Susan would also be a good choice although she wouldn't be able to do much, but then again, neither would an angry Ferazi.
Young men would spend their nights living in the bar, enchanted by the real world, not the shadow which they were limited to because of their civilized existence.
Facing south, Roy could see the mason's road reach to the edge of a precipice and then plummet off the edge, along with the trees and bushes.
I've also got money in case a bribe is needed.
When Roy reached the edge of passage he beheld the whole cavern, taller than a building and as large as the warehouse, with roughly carved ceilings and walls.
John that that it might be a" B" but he couldn't remember after all of these years.
Not giving up yet, I continued to ask him more.
I once had a glass smith attempt to duplicate the device for me, in case my present one broke, but his creation, even though it looked fancier and more impressive, failed to magnify as well and what it did enlarge was done unevenly so that some regions of vision through his copy looked like the reflections of a warped mirror.
He had been so apprehensive that he woke up even before sunrise and had found his way to the warehouse just as the sun was peaking over the rooftops of the buildings.
I, however, escaped the garden unscathed, and when my weary feet returned me home I resolved to forget this case, and should the prankster ever return, I would tell her off, irregardless of her charm.
Chris looked around the room and saw bodies lying everywhere about the floor.
He chewed on some more of the sausage that Dan had brought him earlier, took a drink out of the likewise supplied flask, and looked around at the action and scenery once again.
My scope is the only eye piece which magnifies that I know of, and know sage I've ever shown it to has seen its ilk.
No, its my pleasure.
Having reached the edge of the pit, and attained his goal, Roy sat down to await the cloaked figure's climb.
While he watched Roy ran towards him, Dan tried to estimate when the crossbow bolts would be aimed and fired, but the archers did not have time.
This was a problem, one which Dan didn't exactly want to face, especially this early in the morning.
He hadn't had any for awhile and enjoyed the flavor, both sweet and sour at the same time, an excellent snack for the afternoon.
Dan's brain was finally thawing.
Well, Ted doesn't believe this, but I think it's magic.
Yes, it's a pub about three blocks to the west.
" Uh," Susan hesitated," There's been a problem.
Luckily, the blood on his hands was now dried and didn't wear off on the new sheet.
Zack heard the witch yell at him from inside, but didn't understand any of it.
He watched terrified as the point slowly slid back into his body, feeling the pain of his flesh tearing yet a second time and watching the blood flow increase to a floor.
with such a fate goading at roy, he crept over to the door and reached up, grabbing onto the door's wooden handle as his fingers touched the weathered surface.
It was some sort of curse which he must have had placed on him, or just bad luck.
Officers and their command from the Emperor's army frequented Lloyd's in great numbers, eager for each other's company and satisfied by the quality of the owner.
Roy's belief in magic strengthened more and more as no one ever came out of the warehouse, even though Ted and Mike insisted that magic did not exist and that the man must be getting in and out of the warehouse somehow.
Chris, are you okay?
What if Mike had been enacting some treachery against Caylan, and like pawns, Chris, John, and Dan had naively believed that Mike was somehow innocent and undeserving of his death.
To prove the point, Roy even found claw marks on the wood slat underneath the cage.
The fourth would still be upside down and staring at Chris if its body had not fallen on top of its dangling head.
a Remozsh yesterday.
The butler wouldn't fight, although he might scream for the police, which wouldn't be near enough to hear.
Whoa, just let me explain.
He was amused, and if he weren't so tired, Dan would have chuckled a bit.
Several months later, after having spent some time with the new acquaintance, John would recall his first impressions and make comparisons.
Inevitably they would be insensitive to the plight of a rat allegedly taken prisoner by a wealthy member of the Wizard's guild.
The Ferazi knelt down, using the fingertips of his hands to aid in his balance, and stared straight up at the eaves, looking like both a runner waiting for" On your marks.
As an experiment I later tried wearing chainmail over a fur coat and found it quite comfortable.
Dan ignored the statement.
Having nothing else to do, Dan followed the creature down the main road and off to a small alley, never attempting to close the distance between himself and the Ferazi.
Half an hour later, the two left inviroth's gates and headed north.
He ignored the Remozsh and continued to work at his illumination.
Roy's mother continued from where Ted left off," Hurry up boy and lets go.
He wore extravagant robes, with some sort of red robe underneath a purple overcoat which flared out at the arms and the feet.
Chris took a quit look at the man and was amazed at the man's eyes, which dwelled on Chris, displaying the twin emotions, fear and hate.
there were always new avenues, alleys, and sections of town, so many so that roy had never found the edge of inviroth, the one which led into the wilderness, except when mike was leading him.
Coming in for entertainment, knowledge, and an experience of a life time, city dwellers would listen contentedly to all that was said, occasionally producing a comment of their own about the ways of the world.
Down below, the circular wall completely encircled their two inhabitants with large bricks, except for an opening next to the dangling rope, through which light shone.
A third one had a deep cut in his head from which blood was still trickling.
The beast's ears were laid back, mouth half open open, and coal black eyes glaring.
One of these even connected between the Eagle clan and others, forming the central roadway which would lead throughout then entire city of the Eagle.
The book was filled with a hundred or so pages protected by a thin wooden cover overlaid with black cloth.
Dan and John walked through the door into a reasonable nice establishment with about fifteen tables, almost all of which were still empty, dinner not yet having arrived.
Within a few centuries, the brotherly cities, in cooperation with other new world cities, had driven the Ferazi beyond the forest and constructed several colonial towns farther west, some of which ultimately grew into moderately sized cities.
zack walked back to his closet, found an old baggy shirt, and put it on.
However, anyone that was half awake knew of them, and begrudged the dual tax that they paid to the guild, one through protection payments, and the other through government taxes.
Blood was streaming out of the vertical wound, flowing down the man's stomach and down the right leg where it trickled to the earth, its subterranean course exposed by the blood which was absorbed into the man's clothing.
The ground didn't feel particularly warm to Roy, the darkness and confinement was not comforting, and neither was the smell aromatic.
He'd just have to walk down an alley, hide, and hope that he was followed, jumping on the guy the minute that he walked by.
John climbed down into a completely unknown cellar, wearing wax boiled leather, a sword on his side, a shield strapped to his back, and was entering a situation which might lead into combat.
People keep indoors at night from the mugger enforced curfew and breathe stale air.
Now, Chris was refusing to be a part of the three and was loathe even to talk to them.
He had just returned with his address, the second story apartment at one hundred twenty eight Cadway Street.
After falling, Roy lay there for awhile and tried to get up but the waves continued to increase in strength and he could barely raise himself up with his hands before being pushed first forward by an oncoming wave and then falling back as it rippled past him.
Shelter is only necessary in the cold of winter.
Attached to that was a long hand with stubby fingers, if they could really be called that.
Even Scott had more dignity than Jason whose hair was always messed up, chin covered with un cut stubble, and clothes patched a hundred times over.
Roy's hand reached the rope before the Ferazi even realized that Roy was moving.
just to make sure that it wasn't coming from outside he stepped back and inhaled.
While the cloaked man walked, he hobbled back and forth, his movements rippling down the cloak's fabric which swayed in counter rhythm.
Since nothing had come out yet, Roy took some time to locate the exits, finding eight of them evenly distributes among the four walls.
" Speaking of Jason," inserted Paul," We have to finish this card game.
Since this number corresponded well to Ted's number, and since that's all that had ever been seen entering the building, Chris figured out that it was a reasonable guess, as good as he'd get without going down.
What if his son was really a good man, but he had been low on money to pay the rent or he had to help his father and mother pay off some creditors?
They would pounce on Roy, who would only manage a curt scream before being dragged off, and then he wouldn't do any good to Mike.
John concluded that he had been lucky before and must have missing the rotted are.
One other useful but curious fact about the Remozsh remain, to which not too many are privy because very few care.
How else could ya explain it?
I believe that part of this confusion has arisen from the stream of owners who have claimed the building and clientele, and who occasionally have changed the name's second word back and forth between" Bar"," Pub"," Tavern" and nothing.
When the wizard had lit his way to the third corner, opposite to the stairs and closest to Roy's position, the lamps brought a large bookcase and podium into existence, guarded by several surrounding candles.
This is typically a fairly white male job, not because of discrimination practices, but because very few women or minorities go into the field of computer science.
The wizard's only alternative was sorcery, which was something which he hated using for this kind of business.
Dan, John, and Chris all sat in Chris' bedroom, each leaning up against a corner of the room.
it didn't matter because the thing ran past zack and his alley without even stopping, and all zack could see was a blurred shadow.
Many, after spending a few months exploring the world through the tales of others, would pack up their possessions, buy a sword and horse, and leave the maze of streets, kicking off the dust of the city off their boots after walking under the city gates and entering the open road.
Big chimney that.
Dan looked expectantly and the rabbit along with everyone else, but the Ferazi sat stoically and spoke nothing.
Hey, Bubba, get me another drink.
Science fiction has unrealized technology and aliens that all speak English.
The Human war veterans which I've spoken to couldn't understand the language either, but they all told of one fascinating linguistic element of Ferazi.
Oh, hi Ted.
Attempting a different tactic, Todd e rolled under the bed for some protection, but when he was half way across the bed's underside, a spear point ripped through the bedding and embedded itself into the floor next to Todd's arm.
There's no way that I'm gonna die yet.
Chris might have done so, but he came out of the underground acting strangely and had refused to talk to anyone, even Dan.
There were always plenty of enemy soldiers, with a minimum of one per hero, or at least that was in the books.
When I was in school where there were a higher number of non whites, a had lot more non white friends.
Failing a sluggish effort to dodge the sheets, Dan resorted to pulling them off himself.
What' cha doing here?
Dan and John had both taken off of work early and gone to Mike's apartment after noon, having no other clues to go on except a few rotting bodies left underground, and neither Dan nor John were especially eager to search them for anything useful.
He's probably out shooting cats with it.
I was sure to eventually get a job because of it.
In only a few minutes he would irrevocably commit himself to that path, and his life would soon speed away from dullness.
The commander was enthralled by the display and used his finger as a pointer which darted around the map as it followed his attention.
And make sure that you hang one up at Lloyd's.
Chris randomly stuffed refugee clothes from the bottom drawers elsewhere.
They'd always be asking for money to be used for some mythical cause, to go for new shoes, for their baby, their family, or so that they could eat for the first time in a week.
If the man really was a monster then Roy couldn't kill it, not even the bravest warrior could do so, and Roy would never be able to avenge Mike's murder, at least not alone.
Yeah I know, but I couldn't help it.
Dan tried to pull a set of bars off of the darkened window but was unable to, so he pulled out a crowbar from somewhere and started to pry.
Dan stood up and walked to the edge of the pit where he looked over and yelled," Hey Mike.
Three doors led out of the room, one which the group has standing in front of, another which seemed to connect with an adjacent room which must have already been searched, and a third opposite to the group.
The house even smelled the same, fresh and clean with a bit of sawdust smell from his father's shop.
Mike didn't think so, but speculated that the" factory" was producing something for the Emph Kelzar, and that it must be some of the technological magic which they performed.
Of course, having climbed down the shaft so much over the last week, he must be getting used to it by now.
He told me that I should find someone, a Ferazi I mean, and ask for him.
Luckily, only the cards and beer mugs had fallen on them, while the table had missed, which meant that Zack didn't have to move the table.
I work as a computer programmer.
It seemed smaller now than it had before he left, but he could easily forgive it that.
The horse clipped steadily forward, and just as Roy began to believe that it would canter past the alley, it slowed, seemed to turn, and then took a few steps into the alley.
Both captor and captive resumed the watch of each another.
Smoke tends to rise.
But, with a rabbit in toe, such an excuse wouldn't work.
Jenny's pushing me to get married, and one of these days I'll end up with kids.
I do not wish to impose the true image and personality of a Ferazi upon the unscathed reader's mind, especially the kind and gentle women who are avid readers of my adventures, but I have sworn to detail the intricacies of my journeys, and the demeanor of the five beasts standing before me at this point in the tale is necessarily described.
Those not in the warrior profession will appreciate the view from the castle's towers, especially the great east tower from which one can see an azure sea to the East, a glittering city to the south, purple mountains to the west, and extensive fields of green in the north.
Jong just smirked.
Here ya go!
Unable to move, with his head staring into the corner of the dark living room, Todd tried to see where the rabbit was, but the Ferazi was there somewhere in his periphery.
Did ya know that humans only eat at certain times, and only eat specific food then, and that they've got names fer each of these?
Not seeing anyone around, Dan rang the bell and hoped that it would draw some attention.
After a pause, most likely considering how to put forth the ideas which he and John had discussed earlier, Dan continued.
A normal rabbit has equivalent limbs but in different portions which the reader is well familiar with.
It did not have any racks, fire pits with hot coals, iron maidens, skeletons, or prisoners.
They would be able to get the man, and then Roy really would be a hero, and even more significant, he would have done something for Mike, in adventure which Mike would enjoy.
Oddly though, even though he was about to enter the most surreal portion of the nightmare, it was at this point that the dream became extremely realistic and detailed, and very scary.
He quickly weaved his way through the populace, horses, and donkeys, crouched low so that he head wouldn't be spotted bobbing among the obstructions.
But Chris could not have counted on knocking the man's sword away, and once combat started, he could not have done anything to change events.
I suppose that it was there names but I don't read so I can't tell ya much.
He only managed to look around the immediate household and find the neighboring rooms, but he didn't get to check all of the passages because stones and rubble and partially blocked one passage.
Dan and John walked over to Susan's house where they found her weaving for her mother in a back room, surrounded by the machinery used by her and her mother to make some of the cloth which her father sold.
It did, for as soon as the bell had chimed, three barking hounds ran for the gate and took up positions for its protection, standing right on the other side and growling at Dan, who wasn't sure if the gate was meant to keep him out or the dogs in.
Even though his brothers never had spears to terrorize Todd with, he was in this situation before, trapped under a bed with two older brothers standing on top of it, one waiting on each side of the bed, and Todd did know a trick that worked.
But it's not just that," said the drunk.
To this he looked west for a brief moment and then returned his gaze to me.
The dog nearly pulled me back into the fray, but lucky it only escaped with my sole.
Cause we don't spend money on beds or houses or ritualistic eating.
Because John had to work today, he didn't bother cleaning things up, but instead put off the housework until later on in the evening.
I stopped by for a visit at bob's and asked him if he knew anything about a one eared ferazi.
We don't want to startle the rat.
I'll pay.
Fer my kids, ye know.
After the inevitable grasp of death didn't come, Roy abandoned his fears and continued down, rung by rung, until his left foot met solid earth and Roy had climbed into a barely illuminated room with slightly glowing walls.
Failing to ever get ahold of that Remozsh again, we abducted another one, tied it up, and carried it underground.
Seeing as the stone work upon which I was erected was quite high, I tied my rope to the thorn bush and descended into what appeared the garden of paradise.
Roy sat absolutely still and thought about nothing except the monster stories that his mother had told to him.
A man is never far from an ale establishment in Inviroth, the buildings being strategically placed by some higher intelligence so that one's feet never have to walk for more than two minutes, a trip well worth the exercise.
If I didn't think I'd get to see the world, I'd be dead already.
Caylan could see no reason why, because Clive was also a high ranking official of the Thieves' guild, probably a direct report to the guild's evasive leader.
Now that was a plan which Caylan appreciated, having been on the other end of table before.
Of course, she would not turn him in, but would she ever love him again, her own son who had murdered his brother?
Touching his ear produced almost the same feeling as when he had knocked his tooth out during a fight had touched the virgin gum, except that his gums quickly hardened and lost all sensation.
Luckily, the trio wasn't stopped by any probing police, and didn't even pass any on their way through the city.
But now Mike was dead.
He looked around but didn't see them lying anywhere on the staircase, and now that John was paying attention to his surroundings, he noticed that the light seemed to be dimmer.
The torch light didn't illuminate enough of the ceiling to make it's height discernible, however, and Roy could only see a faint glow where the roof was, not enough detail to get a height.
This has gotten too dangerous and I wouldn't want any of you to end up like Mike, and I would feel very responsible if you did.
Another wave sprang up, this one somewhat distant from the previously active central block.
It was filled with a hundred or so pages, only about half of which had been scribbled on, with a thin wooden cover overlaid with black cloth, a journal by the looks of it.
Since I believe the experts, I cannot admit to the guild controlling the factories.
Neither could the belligerent Ferazi tribes tarnish the colony since their disorganized forays were easily destroyed by Amroth's skilled militia.
Over time, the Remozsh abandoned the small towns to which they had appeared, many of them with physical incentives at their backs, and congregated in the cities where they do odd jobs, beg for food, and make a nuisance of themselves.
Then another squeak escaped and John saw it!
I know, and I am sure that you share my knowledge, that you are dead.
Not too long after entering the passage, Fred, my trusty servant, and I were ensnared by giant arachnids, web spinning wolf spiders the size of a cat.
zack watched carefully as two more people, tom and frank, edged out the door and escaped.
Perhaps this is because Asian Americans are not portrayed as criminals as much on television.
He stood up, grabbed hold of the rope trailing into the pit, and started lowering himself in." Not well.
In the course of the biography, I described to him Inviroth, the city which nurtured and raised me, and verbally illustrated the coastal cliff upon which sat the magnificent castle which sat atop the cliff and watched the great city which lay to the south.
Paul started beaming at this point as he dropped his cards on the table," Read 'em and weep guys.
He continued rising well beyond the torch light, and beyond any jump that Dan could have imagined.
Chris pulled his sword back into a defensive position in anticipation of a counter attack, but the foe stood defensive, his vertical sword ready to parry.
Throughout his entire walk from building to gate, Caylan's hands hung immobile by his side, head kept erect, and his back remained perfectly straight.
The wizard laboriously pulled the tome from its brothers by first tilting it forward to expose some cover area, and then, with both hands, wiggled the volume out.
When I was designing the cultures and personalities of the Ferazi, Remozsh, and Humans, I took traits and history commonly associated from different sub cultures in American societies.
He held out his hands so that todd could place the bow right into them.
The worst outcome, of course, was death, but Dan knew that he was going to die even if he didn't escape Inviroth because he knew the ending of his book.
John recognized idealized images of birds, turtles, and horses.
He didn't care for dandelions as much as clover though, but it was a change in flavor and it definitely was easier to get to.
The bed, dresser, and shelves of baubles were all in the same place where he had abandoned them, sitting there all this time and waiting for his return.
Because of this, so the chief sages tell me, the water is so viscous that anything will easily float on its surface, even gold.
The man walked up to the table, and before speaking anything, picked up a chair and moved it between Dan and John, right in the apex of the corner, and the best spot from which to watch the door.
Roy attempted to pull it into the cage but he couldn't get it through the bars without turning it sideways.
Of course, he was nervous because, even though Chris thought it likely that they could bargain for Mike's release, Chris knew that negotiation might fail and combat would be necessary.
But, half way of the stairs, John's foot went through a rotted board and his leg when through up to his knee, scraping it up pretty badly and almost breaking it.
They did not find the place until Dan had given an urchin fifty cents to lead them there.
He wasn't sure if they had lost their way out and couldn't find the city gates, or if because of some demented upbringing they didn't want to escape the maze.
Some readers familiar with mythology might laughing at our stupidity for not leaving a trail of twine to map our progress, but I can assure them of my cleverness.
" Hey bud," said Dan," Wake up.
Whenever John would walk anywhere, even to the corner bar, bums and street urchins would gravitate directly towards him, completely ignoring anyone else with whom he was walking.
Dan and John then proceeded to get directions to the factory from Susan, and after asking several other helpful people, finally found the factory.
Sure can, as long as ya feed me.
You're only a rat.
One tower had already been blasted away by nature and another was already being under mined by the vines.
The cracks in the plaster and the shadows created by the ceiling joists added to the motion.
Are you asking why I don't kill myself if I can't accomplish my dreams?
Where humans have a leg made of two equally long bones connected to an ankle and then a foot, these beasts had a very muscular leg with a shortened thigh bone, no ankle to speak of, and an elongated foot twice as long as any human's, which appeared to be more of an extension of the leg than a foot, similar to an animal's.
Uh oh.
The card was a two of diamonds, not exactly what Zack needed to win, but at least it didn't put him over the top.
" I will return in a few weeks," said she, and then walked out of the house.
Doing some quick calculations with the new rates, Lloyd determined that he'd soon go out of business and lose all of the money he'd endeavored to save.
He grabbed the paper from me, tore it down the middle, and then proceeded to rip the bundled halves into shreds.
So, dear reader, please continue your current occupation and read on.
roy had once sat and watched an old man sit in a chair on a veranda all day long, just staring and laughing to himself occasionally.
Once again, my hopes plummeted, this time too low to rebound.
By this time, however, Roy's excitement threshold had risen, and watching a magnificently robed wizard walk around an underground hall was no longer very interesting.
Mike's murderer would never be found and Roy would have to suffer the rest of his life knowing that he grasped the opportunity to help Mike, but let it slip away.
Happily, only the fur on the Ferazi's head, arms, and legs was exposed, their chest bearing a lengthy shirt of iron chainmail partially covered by a roughly woven tunic.
Dan had naively expected to solve some mystery, catch a few criminals for the police, and then escape from the city an honorable man.
Would you might if I ran out and got them?
And more to his relief, the ghost didn't reveal itself at all during that time.
Roy had dreamed of this before, of monsters prowling underground just like the stories his mother had told him about lurking terrors and creatures whose fearsome howls could be heard for a day's travel.
in the process of the excursions he attempt to figure out a personality and history for these people, what they were doing, where they were going, what deeds and feelings they'd done in the past, and with all of these roy, as much as he dared, would imagine himself them.
Caylan had just about read every one of them also, which is more than most of the local nobility could say about their fashionable library.
He drew the blade from its sheath and threw the scabbard onto his bed.
Do ya have a sword?
A passage exited from the wall opposite Chris and took a right turn about five meters down the hall.
The castle walls are well placed against the cliff edge, providing protection of the port and excellent sight of incoming vessels.
Taking a session to asses his situation, Todd felt a tremendous pain cry out from his lower ribs and then looked down to see what was wrong.
John had already answered one question with a" What", so he had only four choices now," Where"," When"," How", or" Why".
Perhaps such a painting would not be unlike those of medieval Europe, depicting a castle, church, hamlet, or some other structure in skewed representation, perspective, scale, shading, and size all apparently conflicting from the real birds eye view of the scene, and not to be fixed until the Renaissance.
From a few meters in front of Roy, the ground warped up and then down, sending a circular ripple out from itself, which jolted Roy when it reached him.
Magic had a tendency to leave around enough clues to identify its usage, unnatural sounds coming from the victim's chambers, violent destruction of the room's contents, and either a missing body or a mangled corpse which looks like it was mauled by pride of tigers.
The world just isn't like Derik Halfstar wrote.
" Miss Anderson has told me that her brother, Mike, has been kidnapped," said towards Chris and Dan, but broadcasting it loud enough so that Susan would hear also.
Chris' nightmare had been bad, so horrific that Chris hadn't had one like that ever.
My description now brings the reader's eyes to the final portion of the Ferazi, their legs and feet, which were also inhuman.
A thick vertical column that bubbled and churned did exist within the thing's shape, but calling it a geyser was only a rough approximation.
John's sarcasm and Chris' fantasy weren't helping.
John mused that it's feet were even more filthy than a cat's, and wondered if it ever clean them.
Some days I wake up and don't need any money so I just wander around town and find fun stuff t' do.
The only enemy ever to siege the castle was the ivy which slowly crept up the walls over the centuries, one of Inviroth's stealthy invaders that was sure of its victory.
Although the devices were fairly ineffectual compared to sorcery, they were ultimately traceable to the Organization's factories, especially if one of them went off and the other just happened to be a dud.
The Remozsh first searched around the perimeter of the body for any easy prey, but not finding any knife or sword, he was forced to give the body a closer search.
Those adjacent to the stones were also moving, although only slightly.
Only then did I survey the estate.
So, after climbing a mere twenty three trees, I reached my avian perch and awaited the lord.
The dunk looked over at John and then went back to staring at his drink.
He was never really sure why but he didn't care enough to remove it, and in a way, it made the dresser look better.
We sheathed the blade and stuck it by his dagger.
A few blocks down, Chris saw a short running figure which he assumed was Roy and took of after him with a brisk walk.
I, dear reader, will first lead your intellectual eye towards the ocean's peninsula and then, once there, immediately translate back to the intersection and travel in the contrary direction.
I must ask your pardon m for without your knowledge I have already transported you west of the Garden and Forest road intersection because that is where Lloyd's is found.
I tried ta stop 'em but they threw me off and knocked me out.
Of course, Scott was a pretty poor specimen, well overweight, very much dumpy looking, with poorly clipped short brown hair, a huge nose whose tip seemed to droop downwards.
Family doesn't mean' z much and they aren't' z close.
All of the apartments that he had ever lived in had an odd smell which was never wholly removed, no matter how much John aired them out.
There isn't anything there except lots of smashed up crates and boards.
Ever since he had left home he had never really lived anywhere, never really had anyplace to call his own, but continually moved between apartments looking for a better deal.
" Hey," interrupted Roy," I can watch the wizard's house just like I watched the warehouse.
Satisfied, he let the eyelid close and then looked over the Ferazi's head.
Our top troops even wear steel breast plates, something I have never seen on a Ferazi.
John was relieved as he followed Dan up the stairs and into Mike's already lit apartment, having spent the last fifteen minutes feeling like someone thinking that he was attending a costume party, but walking into a formal, best dress event in which everyone was nicely attired, except himself, who was dressed as a court jester.
Dan's heart rate skyrocketed and he only hoped that his maneuver hadn't attracted any attention.
He gathered together enough lamp oil and candles to last him the night, sat down in his wooden chair, the most uncomfortable item of furniture in the room, and prepared to wait out the night and see if the ghost came.
I'm gonna shoot him.
The central stone gave a sudden lurch downward and then bobbed back up.
Sometimes john would play with people, toy with their minds, in order to see how they would react to different stimuli.
Before Curt could get a word in edge wise, Paul broke in." Speaking of fags, I've got this great story to tell ya.
Tonight, the grand dragon came to gloat over Mike and learn what his mates had tortured out of Mike.
His eyes slid over his thousands of books in the study, thinking of the even more precious ones that he kept away from visitors, and then down to the mahogany desk.
Inevitably, the most blamed organization for city mishaps is the Thieves' guild.
After thoroughly checking it over, he answered," Black.
The downstairs architecture and layout was similar to that on the second floor, a long hallway with doors and lanterns, except that some of the oil lamps along the wall were lit.
" How about just saying that we solve mysteries and crimes"
John hesitated and then replied," Well I just couldn't get to sleep last night.
Perhaps his flowing robes with stars and moons were only for his contrived ceremonies meant to awe noble spectators into submission.
Of course, Chris wouldn't be able to utter any explanation of the past few days, inflaming his mother's curiosity, and causing her to initiate some investigations of her own, only to uncover the blood soaked armor and sword.
It seemed to me that the commander was reserving the right not to answer any question which offended him, which is customary in conversation, but every question I asked, no matter how innocent, was somehow considered indecent so much as to warrant a silent response.
As it turned out, the two had evaded their pursuant someplace around the docks and then wandered around for another hour just to be safe.
After several hours of such disturbing thoughts, he heard some clinking off to his right, much louder than any sounds that he had previously heard.
Following our ears, we wandered through a labyrinth of side passages to find running water.
In order to escape the rain showers, John ran to the end of the hall to where there was a door.
" See I told you it wouldn't work," whispered the black haired one to the other.
Maybe Caylan would sell Roy's freedom.
" Ale," said Dan.
But when do they sleep, what do they eat, what do they do fer fun?
But since I am so harshly deploring the Ferazi race, let me describe my first encounter with Ferazi, one which was typical of all subsequent meetings, to the kind reader so that he may proclaim his own judgment irrespective of mine.
" You've already got half the bartenders in inviroth thinking that you're crazy," commented John," so why not just let the other half in on the secret.
If the dresser managed to fly through the air and hit John he'd either end up with a broken bone, wind up unconscious, or have his neck broken.
I'm gonna knock on his door and ask for Roy back, making up some sort of excuse if necessary.
The terrified Remozsh rattled the cage but stopped on second thought, deciding that such noise might attract attention from the demon, and instead he ran to the opposite end of his prison and as far away from the demon as possible.
Paul blinked, but the image still didn't change.
Before he fell, Roy grabbed the branches of the spiky hedge and held on while the branch around his leg pulled him upward, but just when Roy's arms were fully out stretched and the hedge branches were straining he heard a snap.
While standing around and waiting for Dan, John wondered how many people had ever stood alone in the dark next to an armed Ferazi and lived.
The wizard, with a torch in his left hand, walked down to the bottom of the stairs and when he reached the bottom, lifted his torch up high and against the wall.
Everyone, from the common man to the most well read scholar had told me from my earliest years that Remozsh were a worthless and pointless race whole sole ambitions in life were to eat and breed.
It was a red sock.
Every push of his legs moved him only about a meter forward before he slowed down to a turtle's pace again.
Instead, it was a typical mansion, a sandstone structure with a large rectangular manor speckled by windows, and additional rooms protruding from the design.
even considering mike's odd desire to talk to remozsh, zack was unable to comprehend how mike could deal with anything so loathsome as ferazi, who had been the enemy of inviroth since its inception, and who had, until sixty years ago, been in a deadly and brutal war with the empire.
John was determined to be ready for the poltergeist if it came again, so he gathered up any throw able or extremely lethal objects and locked them inside his closet.
About the waists of each of the Ferazi were belts made of either leather or rope, upon which were hung assorted knives and pouches of unknown contents.
With the three hundred thousand dollars in his pocket, he was forced to find a healthy place to invest the money so as to provide him with an income, and, not wishing to abandon all his hopes, provide him with knowledge or the world and perhaps even some adventure.
The castle is the most impressive sight of the northern metropolis.
This was soon to change with the arrival of a worthy leader.
they all use color to convey an idea.
That scenario was so awful that Zack couldn't even consider it.
If Caylan spread some money around to a few well placed civil servants and essentially hired them to screw up the system, create more paperwork, hold up valuable shipments, and cause the trade to dwindle, Caylan was sure that the Emperor would react.
The people whom Mike found had been outside of Inviroth, were born in other cities, some of the in the mountains, or the swamps, or plains.
Albeit, most of the verbiage was focused on the pleasures of the Remozsh's two favorite cuisines, but not everything was.
Even though a creak in the floor was often unsettling, these were soothing to John because they were inhabitants of his childhood home, along with all of the nostalgic memories which filled the house.
We didn't see any guards and only one chamberlain.
C'mon, lets go get Roy.
If he were to climb down the bush he'd be captured right away.
According to the populace they control not only the back alleys and encompassing muggings, but larger thefts such as the disappearance of cargo and the tax code.
" Would you please move aside from Fred then," stated the cop.
North wasn't the only direction they were destined, and inevitably, each day would bring a new direction, either north, south, east, west, down, or up.
After spilling some of the soup attempting this-- for that's what it smelled like-- Roy decided to leave the bowl outside his cage and used the spoon.
John reconsidered telling Dan about the spirit since Dan was his closest friend and also one of the most level headed guys he knew.
Should he follow Jim or the red haired man?
A little while later the group neared the wizard's house.
Maybe if you wish hard enough she'll come.
He did not want to take his eyes off the body in case it started to breathe again, meaning that the man was alive and that Chris was not a murderer.
John had never managed to do that with his oak stick!
I must have started some sort of avalanche in Angus' mind, for he talked up a storm that lingered on for several hours.
Seeing only three cut throats, equally matched by his three companions, Chris slowed down to scan the room more closely for his own opponent.
The castle was in such disrepair that that nature had already blasted away one tower, and another was being under mined by the vines.
We'll have to stay out here.
His head tilted back as if purposely looking at the ceiling, exposing the muscle and trachea of the lower neck.
But then, Chris pulled the rug out from under John.
Before John could find a new possible trigger however, he heard a click off to his left, a high pitched swish, and then something slammed into the wall right next to his left ear.
However, John was still capable of sharing in their pain as his butt, ankles, and hands began to throb in their dissatisfaction with John's heroic acrobatics.
During this time Lloyd made elaborate plans for himself after he had retired from the army, spending the few moments he gains a respite to ponder his future occupation.
The guard held out his hand for a handshake.
Chris considered pulling them out with his teeth but decided not to, realizing that the blood was that of his murdered victim, and tasting it would almost make Chris a cannibal.
Roy was disappointed because the wizard's abode did not include any spiraling towers with burning fires nor an immense moat with crocodiles idly swimming around and looking for dinner.
Naw, ain't got one.
Anything could be waiting behind that next corner, especially with the strange sound that came from down below.
Stop I said, or I'll throw him in!
After several hours of such thought, he heard some clinking off to his right, much louder than any sounds which he had previously heard.
It must have been some of that dream knowledge, because Chris wasn't capable of identifying a face, being barely able to discern a silhouette.
Burning torches, held by iron hands protruding from the wall, illuminated mosaics of demons on the floor.
The Remozsh are a good example.
About half way down the wall to dan's left was the room's only window, through which the cool night breeze entered, circled around the room, and played with the candle's flame, making the only light source in the room waver and flicker at key points.
Feeling useless sitting on the ground, John suffered more pain by standing up and hauled away the hound which had cushioned his fall.
Dan smiled to show that it was a joke.
The next week I was overflowing with anticipation.
Furiously she retorted," She certainly is not.
Another turn and Chris walked down a narrow passage, damp laundry hanging on ropes above Chris' head.
He heard faint roars from lions, people silently yelling in terror and pain, and other sounds, like conglomerations of different beast's cries, or even a mix of human and beast.
Rather then stop at ground level, his hands quickly sunk in up to his elbows.
Of course, John had tried his best to get out of it, but he had been trapped and forced into the stupidity, because not only had Chris already convinced Dan that breaking and entering was a good idea that was likely to solve the case, but he had also approached Susan and volunteered his two friends for the task.
The wizard walked over his oriental rug, imported from the south east empire and around his enormous mahogany desk.
The Remozsh did a very good job doing both of these.
The creatures, as I learned in later encounters, only raise their ears to listen carefully.
He was both yelling and wriggling around to escape from the wizard's grasp.
I don't want to stock shelves for ever either, you know.
Chapter eleven
but, other people were much more interesting, and provided roy with endless hours of speculation, such as how two men walking along were talking about how the war with the Ferazi had suddenly ended when the emperor had discovered that an underground existed, and how one of the men was doing some investigations into the matter.
I've heard of people starving to death if they haven't eaten any meat.
Once inside these magnificent display cases of the world's artistry, Mike and Roy would look around at all of the items, giving each its time for investigation and conjecture, where it came from, what it was for, and who made it.
Roy took off out the alley, followed by Chris, and wound his way through numerous streets which Chris had never seen, only occasionally making a wrong turn into a dead end and being forced to backtrack.
Most times it's because people want to keep the sub culture" pure.
I didn't think you'd be asleep so early.
While I am discussing pubs, I must take the pulpit and explain why they are such necessary institutions for the community.
She was bigger then, Roy having grown somewhat.
Since I have begun my authorings, I have endeavored to chart many of my dead end trails and swamps hidden to the novice adventurer, and the reader should feel himself fortunate that I have written these many tomes which may guide him upon the adventurer's path and enable to avoid all of the pits and snares which I blundered into.
Additionally, the police would want to know who the witness was and as soon as Dan said that their witness was another rat, they'd walk away.
He hoped that he'd soon forget the incident at the party, wished that he hadn't drunk so much ale, or had been so blitzed that he didn't remember anything and could deny all culpability, but he couldn't.
He hardly minded the vague descriptions of the tunnels.
The center leapt again and another ripple raced away, but this time some of the wave managed to find the border of the pentagram before it died, and reflected off in its last bust of energy.
This one, though, had one of its cut two thirds of the way down, as though it had been attacked by some good ole boy hunters, a few of which John had met.
We've gotta do some rabbit hunting.
He could easily conceive of them making something that didn't have any use at all except to waste time and augment their prison.
He first got his fingers underneath the sheet which was constricting around his neck and tugged outward until he had added up some slack to the noose and was capable of breathing.
I haven't spent years purposefully studying the topic.
The cage was a boxed shape with vertical iron bars on all four sides, a horizontally barred ceiling and floor, laid upon a short wooden base.
During Dan's struggles, the coils slowly diverged paths.
Some other color mixed in with the familiar stone gray, but Dan did not have a name for it.
John, would gladly except this conclusion if it originated from a second source.
It must have been too dark to notice.
Although Dan was gaining too much hope and losing touch with reality, he would be fine as long as he didn't flip like Chris.
He starts out about three years ago when he left home to live in his own apartment.
The first leg of the journey required that I acquire some equipment useful to the adventuring trade.
Dan noticed the man's clothing, expensive and formal, but nothing like the standard wizard's garb which he had expected;
Roy leaned forward in his over turned garbage can and listened, for the most part dearly hoping that the horse would ride past and leave Roy to his brooding and silence, but Roy also longed to find out who had murdered his friend and to do whatever he could to capture the villain.
My parents don't earn that much money, and even if they did, they'd never approve of my travelling.
The area didn't look like anyone had been there since Chris, so he decided that it was safe and opened the door just a crack to look inside.
Hey Zack, ya in?
A woman just stopped by and it seems like she wants to hire us.
But, could Dan, as a hired" expert", approach her asking for help?
It's long feet dragged along the ground behind him, without the slightest attempt to propel himself along, and his head just rolled around from side to side.
However, Dan wasn't too eager to hang around Inviroth so he graciously declined, answering that he was heading up north.
Bob raised it to his lips, and tiled it back for a moment as if he were taking a big swig, even though there was nothing in there.
Dan know that Chris had a lot of the same books on his own shelf.
They must have been skilled horsemen to train their horses to well and then to ride bare back, presumably into combat, for only the best knights in the Empire can do so, and they sport such skills only to woo the ladies.
I think I've got enough.
John didn't give Bob any chance to answer or protest, but got up and took his beer over to a small table over in the corner and sat there, flinching every moment that Bob even looked in his general direction.
It was because of this race that the human colonists did not flourish at first, for the colonists were continually besieged by the belligerent Ferazi, and being forced to protect themselves rather than nurture the soil, very little ground was gained.
The manager seemed genuinely concerned, and Dan was not sure if it was because he cared about Mike or because he knew something else.
Once the limbs had ceased to emerge, the light's color changed.
It was a tall iron gate with sharpened spikes at the top and a large lock to hold it closed.
Unfortunately, he could not wait around for his agent to find the right men.
in his right hand was a club, ready and poised to whack roy over the head when he peaked around the corner to see who was waiting.
Of course, Roy could not understand why the man would enter the building and then leave out another door, but Ted suggested that there must be something important in the warehouse, such as a treasure chest that they had not seen in their hasty search.
Although Chris doubted that Susan knew anything about combat, he needed to talk to Susan about the fee.
Fissures in the liquid stone seemed to form the eyes and mouths of creatures, and Roy imagined that the blobs were captured animals trying to escape from a pit of tar, doing their utmost to keep their head above the black death and occasionally making a futile lunge to escape.
I eventually gained enough curiosity to inquire about the pouches' contents but was rudely denied.
At this point, the enemy was supposed to go flying back into the wall, but instead he took the opportunity and took a diagonal swing.
This strengthens the concept of ownership, which itself has severe ramifications on society.
Uh ted, how'd ya know i was here?
The arms and legs likewise had no edges, and existed as an illuminated body of smoke.
Now let me tell ya, I worked fer a human who had lobster once a week.
Will you turn it around so that I may see it's back?
But, no more than a minute's walk had I gotten when I spied a group of raging canines racing towards me.
Oh yeah, lots of times.
They close up shop and do ta there home, which is the place where they sleep.
Dan left John's apartment but waited just outside the alley entrance until John came out, just to make sure that he was on his way.
now Dan worried that the magic, and the monsters that cohabited it, had not entirely vanished.
The last game had gone well, Paul winning in X moves, but now it was time to deal out another round, probably the fifth that he had done tonight.
finally, zack picked up the leather shirt, checked it for any flaws which might allow a weapon to get though.
The magnifying scope clearly showed me five larger white dots riding horses varying between chestnut, black, and a dark gray.
Maybe a robbery gone wrong or a fall down the stairs.
It was in the west that I first chanced upon a band of Ferazi, while I was traveling on the Great Plains, an amazing beautiful sight for eyes inexperienced with large distances, and heading up towards the Great Salt Sea.
It even smelled as if it had been occupied by some sort of exotic animal that feasted on carrion tossed to it through the iron bars.
" Mike says that all' v the west was owned by the Ferazi and that Inviroth was built over one of their cities.
Luckily his shield blocked the swing, getting a large chip cut out of it rather than Chris' arm.
Its vision bounced from Joes table where time and jack sat, to some others whose names zack had forgotten at the moment, and finally to rest on the goons table, where mike and his buddies jeff and will sat.
He must have just been sleepwalking, and had somehow hurt his arm and leg while doing so.
But I have digressed from my originally stated path, leaving the good reader to wonder where are the anxiously awaited tails of my first foray into adventuring.
In the center of the half dome was a fire pit about half the size of the room, with a torch propped up in the center of it.
John closed the gate behind them, and Dan gave a sigh of relief.
Lloyd even managed to attract the furriers and hunters who came to sell their trophies, newly come from the jungles to the south and full of juicy words to describe the mutually entwined beauty and terror of the jungles and savannas.
Roy continued walking on, and stopped just beyond the cafe.
Chapter eighteen
At that I banged my gavel on anything that I could find, that happening to be the guard's helmet.
once or twice roy had even listened in on some people and concluded them to be member of the thieves guild, wandering around from one contact to another in order to find a good spot for a heist or murder that night.
Roy almost could imagine that he was watching the aviary spectacle on a sun lit plain.
In fact, Zag had astutely determined that Scott only had two shirts and two pairs of breeches, one jacket, and one pair of well aged shoes.
On the periphery would be paintings of the suburbs, very small dwellings each with an accompanying parcel of land, garage, swing set, and perhaps even a pool, all illustrated in flattened medieval style.
Once you've been in it fer a few days' t seems a lot smaller.
Once again she would blame herself for raising her son improperly, for not making him stay home that night, and for a thousand other mistakes she had made.
My ancestry does not define who I am;
Roy's menial presence on that branch was a threat to the hounds that roamed below.
Our eye is well adjusted to contemporary life through its familiarity with the tapestry.
Luckily the sword had a sheath so that the blood would never be seen.
Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed when I finally did come upon a Ferazi specimen, for their reaction didn't even ride the border which most animals think on, but was totally illogical.
His hips, back, head, and arms followed one another, until John was suspended from the ceiling.
Either way, people have taken to calling Ferazi," Rabbits," as a common derogatory name so long as a Ferazi isn't around to hear.
Ferazi are just slightly shorter than a man when standing upon the balls of their heels, and a head taller when on" tip toe", which is their normal walking posture.
The stone path veered in the wrong direction about the middle of the garden and the Remozsh was forced to tramp through the neatly arranged beds of flowers.
Yup, that's exactly what I do.
John looked over the bed next, admiring how neatly made and dressed it was.
Even the sun, watcher over everything, had a difficult time illuminating all of the roads except for the segments which travelled east west.
I'm gonna let this dry for a few minutes.
Chris had apparently begun his hermitage after the night that Dan, John, and Chris went underground.
No, but all humans eat meat.
There were now only four exits out of the chamber that he was in, and there had been seven before.
Nothing could get through the thick iron bars.
Contrary to expectations, he rode out of the city gates with the enormous dragon in tow behind, a servant dog following his master.
zack figured that he had two tries to kick down the door, less than a second to duck, and then the beast would be charging out.
Flabbergasted, I began shouting at him to come back at once and explain himself, but he ignored my ranting and rode back west, barked a command, and was followed by his subordinates away at a gallop.
John doubted that anyone witnessed the events, and even if they had seen them, the impartial witness would be immediately presumed to be in cahoots with John, or he would be considered equally whacked.
Furthermore, every branch anchored a group of transitory leaves that would be abandoned in the fall, but which now waged shadowy war on their cousin branch's colony of leaves below.
Having nothing else to occupy his time, John returned to the white beast and resumed his in depth scrutiny.
Owning a ship had been the most obvious means of achieving most of the goals, but unfortunately Lloyd felt that something above a beggars income in some distant port of call was warranted.
Dan took a swig out of an imaginary beer mug in order to emphasize the point.
" I know I would," answered Zack," The bastard hangs out here all night long but only orders one drink ever.
The Remozsh must have just run in.
Whenever the two were together, either sitting in a room or meandering through the words, Mike would do most of the talking, asking almost all of the questions.
Forgetting about the imagined disturbance, Dan let himself nod back asleep, but instantly reawakened when he felt his sheets move.
They would stand on their double length foot, their head being slightly lower than a man's, but when they had to walk then would rear up and walk as if tip toeing.
We've got a whole barnyard full of costumes.
After debunking his dream of navigating the seas as a prosperous merchant, Lloyd was still left with the problem of employment, self employment preferable.
Roy tried to stand on tip toe to see some of the book's pages but the podium was too high.
Roy backpeddled.
Roy told Mike about his explorations whenever he had such good fortunes and Mike eagerly listened to Roy's stories, peppering them with large numbers of questions exploring details which Roy had forgotten to mention.
The doorway was in front of him, and all that Chris had to do was lift the latch, push open the portal, and his long awaited journey would begin.
Standing over, and either protecting or watching the peasants are slightly larger guardsmen wielding bows and swords, and wearing heavy suits of overlapping circles meant to be their mail.
He briefly considered rummaging though the packs, but decided that it might look odd.
It's a new way of organizing labor so that the workers don't have to be skilled, so that don't have to spend year of apprenticeship.
Roy continued to clench the rope until his hands were pried from it by the stronger Ferazi.
Sure he can.
This was covered with a shirt of rusting chainmail, through whose links tufts of fur stuck out the idiotic creature not even wearing padding underneath.
John grabbed a hold of the top horizontal bar with both hands and went head forward, flipping over and letting go just before his back rammed into the gate.
Of course, being an honest gentleman, I must admit that my youthful foes did not have the armor of my uncle, and would suffer terribly from any blows which I landed.
Mike had told Roy that he should follow people coming out of the warehouse and see where they went, and Roy would certainly be able to show Mike where this cafe was, but Roy also figured that Mike wanted to know more information.
You're here for moral support;
The knocking repeated, this time louder and more frenzied.
and to zacks chagrin, such a ferazi was more dangerous than one who had never been hunted because it was aware of the techniques of the hunters.
Roy took a look around to scope out the general area, noted a tobacco shop with a huge pipe above its doorway, something unique to remember the area by, and started walking down hill, careful to remember the directions that he took.
Did they not have a right to live in their ancestral home that was brutally stolen by the humans?
It was yet another regret solidified by death and permanently stained on his conscience.
Fresh food always emanates wonderful aromas when it's shaken or broken, but the market's fare was always several days old and already rotting by the time it was sold.
She would give up her life, and become a walking corpse, all of the love she had seeping from her soul less cage, and what was left would be the sorrowful reiteration of her son's murder.
Roy's abduction and the story from Mike's manager seemed to form a solid enough foundation to reply upon.
When you're white, a lot of white racists will talk to you openly about their views, expecting that you're also a racist.
" God I hope he doesn't start laughing," said Russ.
The road, called Garden Street for some reason, was not a fertile strip of road as the name implied, but an impenetrable pavement running between walls of shrubbery and grandiose trees.
The leg looked straight, or at least straight enough for now.
Bob continued," Ya know, all I do all day is work.
From Chris' perspective, only able to see the ceiling, part of the window, and to feel his bed, everything seemed correct, but Chris made extra sure to make sure that he was still not living unsuspecting in his nightmare.
I was left to enjoy the visual and olfactory pleasures of the mansion.
" No," said John in an icy voice.
Did they have a statue?
But Dan was still not out of problems because as soon as he walked into the ghetto in the fading light, every Ferazi on the street stared at him full of animosity.
Beyond my work mates, friends, and neighbors, the only people I ever" meet" are on TV or in the movies.
He was wearing different clothes than the two previous times, and now had on a fancy black coat with a light purple shirt underneath, dark blue pants, and slick black boots.
Those leaves caught beneath the shadow of their betters had to satisfy themselves with the occasional ray of light missed by those in elevated positions, and if a leaf could not acquire enough light for the tree, it was merely thrown out and allowed to die as it drifted towards the ground.
Intrigued by the man's disappearance into the warehouse, Mike asked that the exits and entrances be watched more carefully.
This Remozsh, the Hi I'm Roy thing, had no pride.
For the first time that night, the rabbit spoke to Dan," Vie meet ve?
" What're you girls doing," sad zack in good humor.
When Dan ripped free the coiled sheet, his head lifted for a moment while the coiling serpent unwound from his neck, but then once released, his head hit the ground with a thud.
Other large chambers with vault their ceilings and similar pits would be found, leading even deeper into a world of terror, just like Roy's dream.
Furthermore, Zack's throne, being in the south west corner of the essentially square room, was capable of visually inspecting everything and everyone within the room.
He could buy and run a tavern, and with the proper denizens, would hear plenty of the world and perhaps have one or two adventures rub off from his choice clientele onto his own life.
The lot he hired-- temporarily-- was so incompetent that they would never even be able to protect Caylan from a child, or even a Remozsh.
After having entrusted this anecdote to paper, I now wish to finish off the tale with some species of moral, as all good stories must.
This was actually a reasonable hypothesis, since beggars and salesmen could spot John out from a crowd.
C'mon, you must be up to something.
However, I did not language for long for I eventually came upon a brilliant idea;
At most, when Mike and Roy were far from home at dinner time, Mike would buy food for himself and Roy, some bread, cheese, and beer from the stalls lining the streets, sometimes even a sausage or half chicken.
John had met several people who considered the spirits to be real, but those very same people were inevitably lonely old coots who were obviously becoming senile and crazy.
Besides Lloyd's, the west side of Inviroth contains a respective apportionment of lesser pubs, and idyllic maze of streets, and a new business concept known as a" factory.
He had gone off north to find Dan and John.
similar murders had happened in the past along with other strange crimes committed by ferazi such as their breaking into buildings and snooping around the castle.
I will now divert my eyes from Inviroth and gaze into the east, over the inner sea, so that my mirror may reflect the conception of the Empire.
Rather than build up a sizable number of locals to supply a steady business, and hold to the motto," There is a pub on every block, and a block in every pub," Lloyd would forego common practices, and as I said earlier, shun the locals and attract the travelers and army men.
The group did a cursory scan of the attic for Roy but failed to find him amidst the old clothing, sofas, and crates.
Chris should have bene the first one down the hallway;
The door opened shortly, releasing a clamor of clanks, chinks, pounding, and sawing.
Suddenly, Zack heard a loud thud from the door behind him as if something heavy had hit it.
What was moving the chandeliers then?
Everyone at the table, and apparently a few a bit more distant had heard Zack's subconsciously spoken warning and quickly turned around to verify Zack's utterance, that a rabbit had entered the tavern.
" Oh another thing," said the man to Jim.
Genetic appearance is only a vehicle for identifying the culture.
When Roy was underground it was cold, hard to breathe, dark, and he was continually afraid that subterranean monsters would leap out from the shadows.
Cur stood stood up, and to Zack's relief, he was holding cocked crossbow in one hand with a bolt in the other, wildly fidgeting with the mechanisms to insert the bolt.
Of course, I had no inkling of where the path to adventuring began or even towards which direction it traveled.
Over the past few days, Roy had seen nothing except the dogs parading, the one servant running errands, and Caylan's lunch time ceremony of eating outside with his servant standing behind him.
However, I did not lounge for long for I eventually came upon a brilliant idea;
However, he always induced the marvels of the future upon the surfaces of the local geography and people.
The wizard hauled the heavy jar to somewhere around the center of the room, deposited it near a candle, and opened it.
While Dan become more frustrated with the sheets, they began to wrap and wind around his body, becoming more twisted and cord like with each rotation, almost like boa constrictors fashioned from linen.
His captors left Roy in silence to brood and worry about the monsters underground, although after a day or so, he got over the phobia and finally concluded that there were no beasts underground like his mother had said, or at least in this underground room.
Roy checked around the back of his but only found a few stones.
By the time that zack had reached the fifth step, in combined unison of his heavy footed climbing and the creaking that ensued, curt's door opened on top of the landing about six steps above.
" Speaking of which, I'm goin' ta sleep.
Terrified, he leapt backwards, not worrying about the harrowing fall, but his feet, just as they were pushing off, were shackled by the skeletal bush.
By the time he had delivered his last package and limped all of the way back to the dock for pay, he was exhausted, and only had enough energy left to trudge back to his apartment and fall asleep.
I was just wondering what ya thought it was.
Then, the Ferazi's body rolled towards the wizard instead of the anticipated roll away.
Pete and russ quickly realized this trajectory also and demonstrated their knowledge by dropping their jaw and going pale.
Of course, just like anything that was worthwhile, other people were aspiring to the prize.
Either that or the wind was blowing outside and John was so worked up that any barely audible creak was magnified by his paranoia.
Being without armor I spent many a day devising other plans, but was forced to relinquish them all because of some technicality.
Some people even hang for that.
Humans that do not earn a living can starve to death because they can't buy food.
i'll meet ya at my place in thirty minutes"
It exists as the only structure in a city where people, who just hours ago were contented with undermining one another, are able to join together in a common cause, hearty drink, good talk, and camaraderie.
The site is optimal for a city, affording both protection from a castle mounted high upon the northern cliff and a southern port with deep waters.
The thing was not just a one thing, but hundreds if not thousands of other earthly shapes fighting for individuality and escape.
John sat down, grabbed on to the top most rung with his hands, and descended a few steps, noticing the tight fit which his shield, strapped to his back, caused.
Perhaps soon he'd be able to take the return journey and never agin be forced back into the nest of Humans.
The one time Roy could have really helped Mike, Roy let Mike's murderer escape because of Roy's own selfish fear.
it wasn't because they would disagree with his ethics or anything, but because his mother would worry about him, and zack's father didn't like to see his wife worrying.
What was that "Oh baby" last time?
I suspect that this artifact is a carry over from their own language, but none of the scholars to whom I've spoken knew the Ferazi language, nor did they ever hear of any non Ferazi understanding more than a couple of words.
Caylan's legs were push out from underneath himself, causing the wizard to fall forward.
The magic in Mike's books was always much less spectacular.
It contained a sliver of cheese preserved by a wax covering, a now stale roll, and a slice of beef jerky.
" True," siad Paul.
His voice was so amazing that it filled and overflowed the room, squeezing everything else out but the wizard himself, the voice, and the beast.
Dan could have gotten a job hauling a wild panther from the jungle to someone's personal zoo if he had only had a cart and mule, generally more interesting then carrying packages of china up the hill.
All zack could do is wait and hope that someone would attack the preoccupied ferazi from behind, but every second second that the wimps in the bar delayed his life shortened.
Look at the success of the" Cosby Show" in the one thousand, nine hundred eighty 's among whites.
From my sack I connived a piece of meat which I dropped for the hounds' stomachs.
A human has to eat at specific times of the day and has ta eat specific foods then.
The shadow motioned for them to come;
The guard let out a deep breath through is nose.
answered paul jokingly.
Roy turned around and looked at an old, female Remozsh wearing a scarf on her head for a hat.
The Ferazi turned his attention from Susan, and stared right at Chris, who flinched slightly when he became the Ferazi's subject.
A hundred years ago, people were saying that Polish, Italians, and Irish were different races, and people were racist towards these minorities.
Coming through the door with a saddened expression, she apologized.
Paul sat at a small table positioned just off to the side of the fireplace, whose dying fire softly lit the dark room, and thew dancing shadows against the walls.
Oh, me and Roy were talking when three guys came runnin' towards us.
Watching the urchin rat made john immensely grateful that he wasn't one, or even closely related.
But it was too late, the Ferazi landed just an arm's length away from Paul, and took one broad swing with its sword.
