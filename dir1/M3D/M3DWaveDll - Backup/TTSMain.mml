		of this application. You will run out of memory if you are only running the
		32-bit version.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select the <bold>lexicon</bold> to use. <xSN/> is installed with a default
		lexicon for American English (from Carnegie Mellon University); you'll
		find this in the <xSN/> install directory. If you want to do speech recognition
		in another language you'll either need to locate a lexicon for that
		language (see <a href="http://www.mXac.com.au/m3d">http://www.mXac.com.au/m3d</a> for
		a list of lexicons), create your own lexicon using the "mXac NLP Editor" (a huge
		amount of work), or
		use the English lexicon and type in phonetic representations of the non-English
		words.
	</li>
	<li>
		Press <bold>Change speech recognition training</bold> to select training
		done on the person's voice who you'll be creating a TTS voice from.
	</li>
	<li>
		Press the <bold>Identify common words</bold> button so that the TTS voice
		can be recorded using the most common words that will be spoken.
	</li>
	<li>
		Press the <bold>Recommend to-do list</bold> button so the training recommends words
		and sentences to have you speak.
	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Record</bold> the recommended words and sentences. When you record

	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Edit</bold> any recorded sentences that didn't record well.
	</li>
	<li>
		Press <bold>Analyze</bold> so that a TTS voice is created from the recorded voice.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once all the data has been analyed,
		press <bold>Save the text-to-speech voice</bold> in the review page.
	</li>
</ol>

<p/>

<p>
	To produce a <bold>prosody model</bold> you must:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Select the <bold>lexicon</bold> to use, as the same for a master TTS voice.
	</li>
	<p>
		The lexicon should be a derived lexicon (not main) since you'll
		need to <bold>add new words to the lexicon</bold> if they're used in
		the prosody model.
	</p>
	<li>
		Press <bold>Change speech recognition training</bold> to select training
		done on the person's voice who you'll be creating a TTS voice from.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a list of sentences you expect to speak by
		pressing the <bold>Add many items to to-do-list</bold>.

	The more words recorded, the better TTS will sounds, but the larger the TTS file

<xChoiceButton href=joincosts>
	<bold>Calculate target costs</bold> (slow)<br/>
	An internal tool used to calculate the target costs of units for the beam search.
	Only run this if your voice has <bold>5000 or more</bold> sentences.
	This writes the output into the TTS working file, as well as c:\temp\JoinCosts.txt.
</xChoiceButton>

<blockquote>
<xChoiceButton name=deljoincosts>
	<bold>Delete calculated target costs</bold><br/>
	If this button is enabled then you have already calculated target costs for
	this voice. Pressing this button will delete the target costs and cause
	TTS to use default target costs values.
</xChoiceButton>

<xChoiceButton name=saverectranscript>
	<bold>Save the transcript of the recordings to a text file</bold><br/>
	This saves the transcript (text spoken) of the recordings to
	c:\temp\SaveRecTranscript.txt. You can use this to check out-of-lexicon
	words by sending the text file to "Recommend words that
	need pronunciations" in the lexicon editor.
</xChoiceButton>

<xChoiceButton name=import2008>
	<bold>Import recordings for Blizzard 2008</bold><br/>
	Blizzard 2008 comes with an "Utts.Data" file that contains a list of lines
	with "(roger_0000 "`Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?")".
	This parses the line, and writes the text into the .wav file.
	From here, just add the wave files to the project as regular.
</xChoiceButton>

<xChoiceButton name=import2009mandarin>
	<bold>Import recordings for Blizzard 2009 - Mandarin</bold><br/>
	The Blizzard 2009 mandarin voice comes with an "ProText.Data" file that contains a list of files.
	For each file, the first line is an digit number, like "00000005". The second line is chinese characters.
	The third line is pinyin, like "ju4liao2jie3tian1jin1shi4". This reads in the wave file (with .wav added)
	and attached the pinyin text, with spaces between the syllables.
	From here, just add the wave files to the project as regular.
