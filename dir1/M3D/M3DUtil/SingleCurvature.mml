	This page lets you control how each row and column in the surface is curved.

<p>
	Every surface is divided into a number of rows and columns. At the intersection
	of each row/column is a "control point" that can be used to bend/warp the surface.
	The control points appear when you select the surface.
</p>

<p>
	This page allows you to specify how the surface bends in-between the control
	points. Each surface has two directions of bending, from one column to the next, and
	from one row to the next. (Columns are vertical strips, and rows horizontal.)
	You can control the type of bend for each tow and column.
</p>

<p>
	For example: If you want a wall that's straight up and down, but is circular
	as you walk along it, then the "by column" settings should all be "Circular"
	and the "by row" should be "Straight". If you want the wall to be curved up and down,
	but straight left and right, then do the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, things are more complicated than that, because not only can you control
	the bend shape by column and row, you can control it for each column and row.
	You can make a wall which is straight, then curves in a semicircle, is straight for a bit,
	and then curves again. You probably won't do this for most walls, but some walls
	will need it.
</p>

<p>
	The types of curves are:
</p>

<xul>
	<li>
		<bold>Straight</bold> - The "curve" really isn't a curve, but is a straight line.
	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Curved</bold> - Technically it's called a Hermite bi-cubic patch, but just
		think of it as being a curve that isn't circular.
	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Semi-circle (next)</bold> - The curve is part of a circle. Because three
		points are needed to define a circle, the points on either side of the row/column
		are used, and a third one is also included, the next point over. (If you set the
		last column/row to this you'll just get a straight line.) The
		circle is drawn so that all three points end up being on it. Typically, you
		will alternate between "Semi-circle (next)" and "Semi-circle (previous)".
	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Semi-circle (previous)</bold> - The curve is part of a circle. Because three
		points are needed to define a circle, the points on either side of the row/column
		are used, and a third one is also included, the previous point. (If you set the
		first column/row to this you'll just get a straight line.) The
		circle is drawn so that all three points end up being on it. Typically, you
		will alternate between "Semi-circle (next)" and "Semi-circle (previous)".
	</li>
	<li>
		<bold>Semi-ellipse (next)</bold> - This draws 1/8th of an ellpse - kind of.
		You need to have three sequential control points (by column or row) arranged
		to form a 90 degree angle to get an eigth of an ellipse. If the angle between the 1st
		and the 2nd, and the 2nd and the 3rd point is not 90 degrees you'll get
		a kind of squashed ellipse. The points used are the ones on either side of the
		row/column, and the next point over. (If you set the
		last column/row to this you'll just get a straight line.)
		Typically, you
		will alternate between "Semi-ellipse (next)" and "Semi-ellipse (previous)".
	</li>
	<li>
