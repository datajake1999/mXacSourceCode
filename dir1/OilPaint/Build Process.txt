Oil Painting Assistant helps you produce oil paintings of images from a scanner, digital camera, or the web. With Oil Painting Assistant, you load in a digital image, crop it to fit your canvas, and adjust coloration to suit your tastes. It also applies a grid to the image so you can more accurately sketch on your canvas. The assistant then displays an analysis of the image showing what paints would be useful for the painting’s base coat. The analysis and grid-overlaid image can be displayed on your monitor while you paint, or printed on a color printer.

It requires a Windows (95, 98, NT 4.0, NT 2000) PC. Minimum requirements are a Pentium 100 with 16 megs RAM.

The OilPaint.Exe file that you are about to download is the application itself. Therefore, you should download it into the directory which you wish to run Stochastic from.
